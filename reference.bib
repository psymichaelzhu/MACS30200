	abstract = {Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a single, unified discipline with the ultimate aim of providing a single, general theory of human behavior. This is the emerging field of neuroeconomics in which consilience, the accordance of two or more inductions drawn from different groups of phenomena, seems to be operating. Economists and psychologists are providing rich conceptual tools for understanding and modeling behavior, while neurobiologists provide tools for the study of mechanism. The goal of this discipline is thus to understand the processes that connect sensation and action by revealing the neurobiological mechanisms by which decisions are made. This review describes recent developments in neuroeconomics from both behavioral and biological perspectives.},

	abstract = {Neuroeconomics has further bridged the once disparate ﬁelds of economics and psychology. Such convergence is almost exclusively attributable to changes within economics. Neuroeconomics has inspired more change within economics than within psychology because the most important ﬁndings in neuroeconomics have posed more of a challenge to the standard economic perspective. Neuroeconomics has primarily challenged the standard economic assumption that decision making is a unitary process—a simple matter of integrated and coherent utility maximization—suggesting instead that it is driven by the interaction between automatic and controlled processes. This article reviews neuroeconomic research in three domains of interest to both economists and psychologists: decision making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social decision making. In addition to reviewing new economic models inspired by this research, we also discuss how neuroeconomics may inﬂuence future work in psychology.},

Did these ubiquitous spatial metaphors arise in language coincidentally or did they arise because they are rooted in a common neural computation? To address this question, we used statistical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human {fMRI} data. First, a machine learning algorithm was trained to discriminate patterns of {fMRI} responses based on relative egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g., photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to the immediate or more remote future within temporal distance trials; photographs of participants' friends or acquaintances within social distance trials). This procedure was repeated using all possible combinations of distance domains for training and testing the classifier. In all cases, above-chance decoding across distance domains was possible in the right inferior parietal lobule ({IPL}). Furthermore, the representational similarity structure within this brain area reflected participants' own judgments of spatial distance, temporal soon-ness, and social familiarity. Thus, the right {IPL} may contain a parsimonious encoding of proximity to self in spatial, temporal, and social frames of reference.},

Do similarities among friends reflect deeper similarities in how we perceive, interpret, and respond to the world? To test whether friendship, and more generally, social network proximity, is associated with increased similarity of real-time mental responding, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan subjects’ brains during free viewing of naturalistic movies. Here we show evidence for neural homophily: neural responses when viewing audiovisual movies are exceptionally similar among friends, and that similarity decreases with increasing distance in a real-world social network. These results suggest that we are exceptionally similar to our friends in how we perceive and respond to the world around us, which has implications for interpersonal influence and attraction.},

	abstract = {Prediction-error signals consistent with formal models of “reinforcement learning” ({RL}) have repeatedly been found within dopaminergic nuclei of the midbrain and dopaminoceptive areas of the striatum. However, the precise form of the {RL} algorithms implemented in the human brain is not yet well determined. Here, we created a novel paradigm optimized to dissociate the subtypes of reward-prediction errors that function as the key computational signatures of two distinct classes of {RL} models—namely, “actor/critic” models and action-value-learning models (e.g., the Q-learning model). The state-value-prediction error ({SVPE}), which is independent of actions, is a hallmark of the actor/critic architecture, whereas the action-value-prediction error ({AVPE}) is the distinguishing feature of action-value-learning algorithms. To test for the presence of these prediction-error signals in the brain, we scanned human participants with a high-resolution functional magnetic-resonance imaging ({fMRI}) protocol optimized to enable measurement of neural activity in the dopaminergic midbrain as well as the striatal areas to which it projects. In keeping with the actor/critic model, the {SVPE} signal was detected in the substantia nigra. The {SVPE} was also clearly present in both the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum. However, alongside these purely state-value-based computations we also found evidence for {AVPE} signals throughout the striatum. These high-resolution {fMRI} findings suggest that model-free aspects of reward learning in humans can be explained algorithmically with {RL} in terms of an actor/critic mechanism operating in parallel with a system for more direct action-value learning.},

How people are nevertheless able to solve novel problems when their actions have long-reaching consequences is thus a long-standing question in cognitive science. To address this question, we propose a model of resource-constrained planning that allows us to derive optimal planning strategies. We find that previously proposed heuristics such as best-first search are near optimal under some circumstances but not others. In a mouse-tracking paradigm, we show that people adapt their planning strategies accordingly, planning in a manner that is broadly consistent with the optimal model but not with any single heuristic model. We also find systematic deviations from the optimal model that might result from additional cognitive constraints that are yet to be uncovered.},

Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. We propose a normative theory predicting which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal ‘replay’ of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task in which an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices versus the gain from propagating newly encountered information to preceding locations. Our theory offers a simple explanation for numerous findings about place cells; unifies seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning, and consolidation; and posits a mechanism whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.},

Statisticians, engineers and economists have long considered ways of balancing the costs and benefits of exploration. Tests involving a gambling task and an {fMRI} brain scanner now show that humans appear to obey similar principles when considering their options. The players had to balance the desire to select the richest option based on accumulated experience against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might have a larger payoff. The frontopolar cortex, a brain area known to be involved in cognitive control, was preferentially active during exploratory decisions. The results suggest a neurobiological account of human exploration and point to a new area for behavioural and neural investigations.},

This form of learning is often assumed to require simulation of the other by direct recruitment of one's own valuation process to model the other's process. However, the cognitive and neural mechanism of simulation learning is not known. Using behavior, modeling, and {fMRI}, we show that simulation involves two learning signals in a hierarchical arrangement. A simulated-other's reward prediction error processed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediated simulation by direct recruitment, being identical for valuation of the self and simulated-other. However, direct recruitment was insufficient for learning, and also required observation of the other's choices to generate a simulated-other's action prediction error encoded in dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that simulation uses a core prefrontal circuit for modeling the other's valuation to generate prediction and an adjunct circuit for tracking behavioral variation to refine prediction.},

Here, using model-based {fMRI} and Public-good-games, we find that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes immediate expected rewards as individual utility while the lateral frontopolar cortex encodes group utility (i.e., pending rewards of alternative strategies beneficial for the group). When it is required to change one’s strategy, these brain regions exhibited changes in functional interactions with brain regions engaged in switching strategies. Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex and the temporoparietal junction updated beliefs about the decision of others during interactions.

	abstract = {Using word embeddings from 850 billion words in English-language Google Books, we provide an extensive analysis of historical change and stability in social group representations (stereotypes) across a long timeframe (from 1800 to 1999), for a large number of social group targets (Black, White, Asian, Irish, Hispanic, Native American, Man, Woman, Old, Young, Fat, Thin, Rich, Poor), and their emergent, bottom-up associations with 14,000 words and a subset of 600 traits. The results provide a nuanced picture of change and persistence in stereotypes across 200 y. Change was observed in the top-associated words and traits: Whether analyzing the top 10 or 50 associates, at least 50\% of top associates changed across successive decades. Despite this changing content of top-associated words, the average valence (positivity/negativity) of these top stereotypes was generally persistent. Ultimately, through advances in the availability of historical word embeddings, this study offers a comprehensive characterization of both change and persistence in social group representations as revealed through books of the English-speaking world from 1800 to 1999.},

	abstract = {Decoding speech from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare and neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in this regard: deep-learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings can now start to decode elementary linguistic features such as letters, words and audio-spectrograms. However, extending this approach to natural speech and non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a model trained with contrastive learning to decode self-supervised representations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large cohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and integrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with magneto-encephalography or electro-encephalography while they listened to short stories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify, from 3 seconds of magneto-encephalography signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41\% accuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across participants, and with up to 80\% in the best participants—a performance that allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The comparison of our model with a variety of baselines highlights the importance of a contrastive objective, pretrained representations of speech and a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across multiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder’s predictions suggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic representations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from non-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from brain activity, without putting patients at risk of brain surgery.},

	abstract = {What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of {NeuroAI} often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for {NeuroAI}, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``{NeuroAI} Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and {\textbackslash}emph\{additionally\} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and {AI} development.},

A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world1–6. However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep. Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.},

As such aa favors features that constitute representative ‘corners’ of the data, i.e., distinct aspects or archetypes. We currently show that aa enjoys the interpretability of clustering – without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of svd – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale aa, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote {FurthestSum} that is inspired by the {FurthestFirst} approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the aa procedure to kernel-aa in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of aa when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the aa model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data. Matlab code for the derived algorithms is available for download from www.mortenmorup.dk.},

To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the Archetypal Analysis framework introduced by Cutler \& Breiman (1994) and present Archetypal {SAEs} (A-{SAE}), wherein dictionary atoms are constrained to the convex hull of data. This geometric anchoring significantly enhances the stability of inferred dictionaries, and their mildly relaxed variants {RA}-{SAEs} further match state-of-the-art reconstruction abilities. To rigorously assess dictionary quality learned by {SAEs}, we introduce two new benchmarks that test (i) plausibility, if dictionaries recover "true" classification directions and (ii) identifiability, if dictionaries disentangle synthetic concept mixtures. Across all evaluations, {RA}-{SAEs} consistently yield more structured representations while uncovering novel, semantically meaningful concepts in large-scale vision models.},

Here, we use a domain-general method to extract context-dependent relationships from word embeddings: ‘semantic projection’ of word-vectors onto lines that represent features such as size (the line connecting the words ‘small’ and ‘big’) or danger (‘safe’ to ‘dangerous’), analogous to ‘mental scales’. This method recovers human judgements across various object categories and properties. Thus, the geometry of word embeddings explicitly represents a wealth of context-dependent world knowledge.},

How, if at all, should these developments in {AI} influence cognitive science? We argue that progress in {AI} offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and {AI} that suggests that incorporating a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms (and models that accommodate them) may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure that our theories generalize. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in {AI} and cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding. We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural cognition - together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles by which they do so.},

We develop a conceptual and methodological approach to investigating such interdependence and apply it to attitudes toward 17 social groups, the broadest set of measures available to date. We identify three subpopulations with distinct attitude logics: partisans, who feel warm toward groups commonly associated with their political party and cool toward those linked to the out-party; racials, distinguished by their consistently warmer or cooler feelings toward all racial groups relative to other forms of social group membership; and neutrals, who generally evaluate social groups neither warmly nor coolly. Individuals’ social positions and experiences, particularly the strength of their partisanship, their race, and their experience of racial discrimination, inform how they construe the social space. These findings shed light on contemporary political and social divisions while expanding the toolkit available for the study of attitudes toward social groups.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.00276},
	abstract = {Scaling up neural networks has led to remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, performance often follows reliable scaling laws as a function of training set size, model size, and compute, which offers valuable guidance as large-scale experiments are becoming increasingly expensive. However, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data {\textbackslash}\& models or focused on uni-modal language or vision learning. To address these limitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image pre-training ({CLIP}) with the public {LAION} dataset and the open-source {OpenCLIP} repository. Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two billion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and end-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role in scaling laws as the {OpenAI} and {OpenCLIP} models exhibit different scaling behavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We open-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest public {CLIP} models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research more accessible.

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn {SOTA} image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as {OCR}, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original {ResNet}-50 on {ImageNet} zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

Since then, large-scale language-vision models like {ALIGN}, {BASIC}, {GLIDE}, Flamingo and Imagen made further improvements. Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets containing billions of image-text pairs.

	abstract = {Learning to rank has recently emerged as an attractive technique to train deep convolutional neural networks for various computer vision tasks. Pairwise ranking, in particular, has been successful in multi-label image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. However, most existing approaches use the hinge loss to train their models, which is non-smooth and thus is difficult to optimize especially with deep networks. Furthermore, they employ simple heuristics, such as top-k or thresholding, to determine which labels to include in the output from a ranked list of labels, which limits their use in the real-world setting. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve pairwise ranking based multi-label image classification: (1) we propose a novel loss function for pairwise ranking, which is smooth everywhere and thus is easier to optimize; and (2) we incorporate a label decision module into the model, estimating the optimal confidence thresholds for each visual concept. We provide theoretical analyses of our loss function in the Bayes consistency and risk minimization framework, and show its benefit over existing pairwise ranking formulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three large-scale datasets, {VOC}2007, {NUS}-{WIDE} and {MS}-{COCO}, achieving the best reported results in the literature.},

However, most large-scale datasets built to train models for action recognition in video only provide a single label per video. Consequently, models can be incorrectly penalized for classifying actions that exist in the videos but are not explicitly labeled and do not learn the full spectrum of information present in each video in training. Towards this goal, we present the Multi-Moments in Time dataset (M-{MiT}) which includes over two million action labels for over one million three second videos. This multi-label dataset introduces novel challenges on how to train and analyze models for multi-action detection. Here, we present baseline results for multi-action recognition using loss functions adapted for long tail multi-label learning, provide improved methods for visualizing and interpreting models trained for multi-label action detection and show the strength of transferring models trained on M-{MiT} to smaller datasets.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Kinetics has two orders of magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400 clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging {YouTube} videos. We provide an analysis on how current architectures fare on the task of action classification on this dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics.

Owing to this subtle methodological change, the brain's capacity to understand other people's interactions and relationships from limited visual information––also known as people watching––has become a distinct topic of inquiry. Though initial evidence indicates that this capacity relies on several well-known networks of the social brain (including the person-perception network, the action-observation network, and the mentalizing network), a comprehensive framework of people watching must overcome three major challenges. First, it must develop a taxonomy of judgments that people habitually make when witnessing the encounters of others. Second, it must clarify which visual cues give rise to these encounter-based judgments. Third, it must elucidate how and why several brain networks work together to accomplish these judgments. To advance all three lines of research, we summarize what is currently known as well as what remains to be studied about the neuroscience of people watching.},

These interactions are built on the dynamic integration and coordination of verbal and non-verbal information between multiple people. However, the psychological processes underlying face-to-face interaction remain difficult to study. In this Review, we discuss three ways the multimodal phenomena underlying face-to-face social interaction can be organized to provide a solid basis for theory development. Next, we review three types of theory of social interaction: theories that focus on the social meaning of actions, theories that explain actions in terms of simple behaviour rules and theories that rely on rich cognitive models of the internal states of others. Finally, we address how different methods can be used to distinguish between theories, showcasing new approaches and outlining important directions for future research. Advances in how face-to-face social interaction can be studied, combined with a renewed focus on cognitive theories, could lead to a renaissance in social interaction research and advance scientific understanding of face-to-face interaction and its underlying cognitive foundations.},

	abstract = {Neuronal population codes are increasingly being investigated with multivariate pattern-information analyses. A key challenge is to use measured brain-activity patterns to test computational models of brain information processing. One approach to this problem is representational similarity analysis ({RSA}), which characterizes a representation in a brain or computational model by the distance matrix of the response patterns elicited by a set of stimuli. The representational distance matrix encapsulates what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what distinctions are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is tested by comparing the representational distance matrix it predicts to that of a measured brain region. {RSA} also enables us to compare representations between stages of processing within a given brain or model, between brain and behavioral data, and between individuals and species. Here, we introduce a Matlab toolbox for {RSA}. The toolbox supports an analysis approach that is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to help integrate a wide range of computational models into the analysis of multichannel brain-activity measurements as provided by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques. Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate sets of models to sets of brain regions and to statistically test and compare the models using nonparametric inference methods. The toolbox supports searchlight-based {RSA}, to continuously map a measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code with a specific geometry. Finally, we introduce the linear-discriminant t value as a measure of representational discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding analyses and {RSA}. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the toolbox, we apply it to both simulated and real {fMRI} data. The key functions are equally applicable to other modalities of brain-activity measurement. The toolbox is freely available to the community under an open-source license agreement (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/license/).},

	abstract = {What can we learn from comparing video models to human brains, arguably the most efficient and effective video processing systems in existence? Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging ({fMRI}) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of {CNNs} and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Brain network analyses have moved to the forefront of neuroimaging research over the last decade. However, methods for statistically comparing groups of networks have lagged behind. These comparisons have great appeal for researchers interested in gaining further insight into complex brain function and how it changes across different mental states and disease conditions. Current comparison approaches generally either rely on a summary metric or on mass-univariate nodal or edge-based comparisons that ignore the inherent topological properties of the network, yielding little power and failing to make network level comparisons. Gleaning deeper insights into normal and abnormal changes in complex brain function demands methods that take advantage of the wealth of data present in an entire brain network. Here we propose a permutation testing framework that allows comparing groups of networks while incorporating topological features inherent in each individual network. We validate our approach using simulated data with known group differences. We then apply the method to functional brain networks derived from {fMRI} data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In neuroimaging, for example, brain mapping analysis has focused on the discovery of activation, i.e., of extended brain regions whose average activity changes across experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a more general question of the data: Where in the brain does the activity pattern contain information about the experimental condition? To address this question, we propose scanning the imaged volume with a “searchlight,” whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location in the brain.},

The cognitive demands of navigating such groups are thought to have significantly influenced human brain evolution2. Yet little is known about how and to what extent the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded. We characterized the social network of an academic cohort (N = 275); a subset (N = 21) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study involving viewing individuals who varied in terms of ‘degrees of separation’ from themselves (social distance), the extent to which they were well-connected to well-connected others (eigenvector centrality) and the extent to which they connected otherwise unconnected individuals (brokerage). Understanding these characteristics of social network position requires tracking direct relationships, bonds between third parties and the broader network topology. Pairing network data with multi-voxel pattern analysis, we show that information about social network position is accurately perceived and spontaneously activated when encountering familiar individuals. These findings elucidate how the human brain encodes the structure of its social world and underscore the importance of integrating an understanding of social networks into the study of social perception.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how {AI} can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of {AI} has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the “dark matter” of {AI}. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social {NeuroAI} and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, this hypothesis-driven work cannot reveal how prominent these category selectivities are in the overall functional organization of the visual cortex, or what others might exist that scientists have not thought to look for. Furthermore, standard voxel-wise tests cannot detect distinct neural selectivities that coexist within voxels. To overcome these limitations, we used data-driven voxel decomposition methods to identify the main components underlying {fMRI} responses to thousands of complex photographic images. Our hypothesis-neutral analysis rediscovered components selective for faces, places, bodies, and words, validating our method and showing that these selectivities are dominant features of the ventral visual pathway. The analysis also revealed an unexpected component with a distinct anatomical distribution that responded highly selectively to images of food. Alternative accounts based on low- to mid-level visual features, such as color, shape, or texture, failed to account for the food selectivity of this component. High-throughput testing and control experiments with matched stimuli on a highly accurate computational model of this component confirm its selectivity for food. We registered our methods and hypotheses before replicating them on held-out participants and in a novel dataset. These findings demonstrate the power of data-driven methods and show that the dominant neural responses of the ventral visual pathway include not only selectivities for faces, scenes, bodies, and words but also the visually heterogeneous category of food, thus constraining accounts of when and why functional specialization arises in the cortex.},

Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans, such as in Atari, Go, poker and {StarCraft}. The way in which deep reinforcement learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.},

	shorttitle = {Keeping an Eye Out for Change},
	abstract = {Background
Human learning unfolds under uncertainty. Uncertainty is heterogeneous with different forms exerting distinct influences on learning. While one can be uncertain about what to do to maximize rewarding outcomes, known as policy uncertainty, one can also be uncertain about general world knowledge, known as epistemic uncertainty ({EU}). In complex and naturalistic environments such as the social world, adaptive learning may hinge on striking a balance between attending to and resolving each type of uncertainty. Prior work illustrates that people with anxiety—those with increased threat and uncertainty sensitivity—learn less from aversive outcomes, particularly as outcomes become more uncertain. How does a learner adaptively trade-off between attending to these distinct sources of uncertainty to successfully learn about their social environment?
Methods
We developed a novel eye-tracking method to capture highly granular estimates of policy uncertainty and {EU} based on gaze patterns and pupil diameter (a physiological estimate of arousal).
Results
These empirically derived uncertainty measures revealed that humans (N = 94) flexibly switched between resolving policy uncertainty and {EU} to adaptively learn about which individuals can be trusted and which should be avoided. However, those with increased anxiety (n = 49) did not flexibly switch between resolving policy uncertainty and {EU} and instead expressed less uncertainty overall.
Conclusions
Combining modeling and eye-tracking techniques, we show that altered learning in people with anxiety emerged from an insensitivity to policy uncertainty and rigid choice policies, leading to maladaptive behaviors with untrustworthy people.},

For example, voting, rating, and social innovation are collective intelligence tasks that require costly individual contributions. As a result, members of a group often free ride on the information contributed by intrinsically motivated people. Are intrinsically motivated agents the best participants in collective decisions? We embedded a collective intelligence task in a large-scale, virtual world public good game and found that participants who joined the information system but were reluctant to contribute to the public good (free riders) provided more accurate evaluations, whereas participants who rated frequently underperformed. Testing the underlying mechanism revealed that a negative rating bias in free riders is associated with higher accuracy. Importantly, incentivizing evaluations amplifies the relative influence of participants who tend to free ride without altering the (higher) quality of their evaluations, thereby improving collective intelligence. These results suggest that many of the currently available information systems, which strongly select for intrinsically motivated participants, underperform and that collective intelligence can benefit from incentivizing free riding members to engage. More generally, enhancing the diversity of contributor motivations can improve collective intelligence in settings that are entangled with collective action problems.},

	abstract = {Speech and song have been transmitted orally for countless human generations, changing over time under the influence of biological, cognitive, and cultural pressures. Cross-cultural regularities and diversities in human song are thought to emerge from this transmission process, but testing how underlying mechanisms contribute to musical structures remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce an automatic online pipeline that streamlines large-scale cultural transmission experiments using a sophisticated and naturalistic modality: singing. We quantify the evolution of 3,424 melodies orally transmitted across 1,797 participants in the United States and India. This approach produces a high-resolution characterization of how oral transmission shapes melody, revealing the emergence of structures that are consistent with widespread musical features observed cross-culturally (small pitch sets, small pitch intervals, and arch-shaped melodic contours). We show how the emergence of these structures is constrained by individual biases in our participants—vocal constraints, working memory, and cultural exposure—which determine the size, shape, and complexity of evolving melodies. However, their ultimate effect on population-level structures depends on social dynamics taking place during cultural transmission. When participants recursively imitate their own productions (individual transmission), musical structures evolve slowly and heterogeneously, reflecting idiosyncratic musical biases. When participants instead imitate others’ productions (social transmission), melodies rapidly shift toward homogeneous structures, reflecting shared structural biases that may underpin cross-cultural variation. These results provide the first quantitative characterization of the rich collection of biases that oral transmission imposes on music evolution, giving us a new understanding of how human song structures emerge via cultural transmission.},

	abstract = {A core problem in cognitive science and machine learning is to understand how humans derive semantic representations from perceptual objects, such as color from an apple, pleasantness from a musical chord, or seriousness from a face. Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People ({MCMCP}) is a prominent method for studying such representations, in which participants are presented with binary choice trials constructed such that the decisions follow a Markov Chain Monte Carlo acceptance rule. However, while {MCMCP} has strong asymptotic properties, its binary choice paradigm generates relatively little information per trial, and its local proposal function makes it slow to explore the parameter space and find the modes of the distribution. Here we therefore generalize {MCMCP} to a continuous-sampling paradigm, where in each iteration the participant uses a slider to continuously manipulate a single stimulus dimension to optimize a given criterion such as ‘pleasantness’. We formulate both methods from a utility-theory perspective, and show that the new method can be interpreted as ‘Gibbs Sampling with People’ ({GSP}). Further, we introduce an aggregation parameter to the transition step, and show that this parameter can be manipulated to flexibly shift between Gibbs sampling and deterministic optimization. In an initial study, we show {GSP} clearly outperforming {MCMCP}; we then show that {GSP} provides novel and interpretable results in three other domains, namely musical chords, vocal emotions, and faces. We validate these results through large-scale perceptual rating experiments. The final experiments use {GSP} to navigate the latent space of a state-of-the-art image synthesis network ({StyleGAN}), a promising approach for applying {GSP} to high-dimensional perceptual spaces.

	abstract = {The phenomenon of musical consonance is an essential feature in diverse musical styles. The traditional belief, supported by centuries of Western music theory and psychological studies, is that consonance derives from simple (harmonic) frequency ratios between tones and is insensitive to timbre. Here we show through five large-scale behavioral studies, comprising 235,440 human judgments from {US} and South Korean populations, that harmonic consonance preferences can be reshaped by timbral manipulations, even as far as to induce preferences for inharmonic intervals. We show how such effects may suggest perceptual origins for diverse scale systems ranging from the gamelan’s slendro scale to the tuning of Western mean-tone and equal-tempered scales. Through computational modeling we show that these timbral manipulations dissociate competing psychoacoustic mechanisms underlying consonance, and we derive an updated computational model combining liking of harmonicity, disliking of fast beats (roughness), and liking of slow beats. Altogether, this work showcases how large-scale behavioral experiments can inform classical questions in auditory perception.},

	abstract = {An essential function of the human visual system is to locate objects in space and navigate the environment. Due to limited resources, the visual system achieves this by combining imperfect sensory information with a belief state about locations in a scene, resulting in systematic distortions and biases. These biases can be captured by a Bayesian model in which internal beliefs are expressed in a prior probability distribution over locations in a scene. We introduce a paradigm that enables us to measure these priors by iterating a simple memory task where the response of one participant becomes the stimulus for the next. This approach reveals an unprecedented richness and level of detail in these priors, suggesting a different way to think about biases in spatial memory. A prior distribution on locations in a visual scene can reflect the selective allocation of coding resources to different visual regions during encoding (“efficient encoding”). This selective allocation predicts that locations in the scene will be encoded with variable precision, in contrast to previous work that has assumed fixed encoding precision regardless of location. We demonstrate that perceptual biases covary with variations in discrimination accuracy, a finding that is aligned with simulations of our efficient encoding model but not the traditional fixed encoding view. This work demonstrates the promise of using nonparametric data-driven approaches that combine crowdsourcing with the careful curation of information transmission within social networks to reveal the hidden structure of shared visual representations.},

	abstract = {Collective engagement with culture including music and the arts can trace societal changes associated with acute disruptions, such as pandemics, political movements, and wars. Can the daily shared experiences of culture reveal deep and long lasting societal impacts of disturbances? We collected longitudinal data of 12.8 million music discoveries via Shazam across 1,423 cities and 53 countries, relating them to the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Among post-Soviet countries, results revealed cascades of societal disintegration that rapidly escalated during the invasion. Initially similar music discoveries across countries broke down into distinct clusters that persisted over months. Cultural shifts were asymmetric: Ukraine saw a stark rise in the discovery of local, patriotic music, while Russia experienced a moderate decrease in their local music. At the city-level, socio-cultural values predicted subnational changes in music discovery inflicted by the war, bringing to surface latent variations within Ukraine and Russia. Interestingly, in Belarus, despite their political alliance with Russia, discoveries of Russian music decreased while Ukrainian music increased, suggesting undercurrents and resistance. Our work provides insights into the interactions between culture and society, revealing the pathways through which societal disruptions imprint the evolution of culture.},

We use Large Language Models ({LLMs}) to simulate the limits of globalization by reproducing the naming task with a highly multilingual artificial agent with access to global digital information. We show that while the {LLM} has access to all languages, it has language-specific color representations and the number of color terms is correlated across humans and {LLMs}. However, {LLMs} use more color terms than humans, indicating differences in the representation. These results suggest that globalization has not removed cultural distinctions in color concepts, as language continues to be a key factor in the diversity of perception and meaning.},

	abstract = {Conversational tones -- the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate -- are essential to effective communication. Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models ({LLMs}) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans. However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains. Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone. We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and {GPT}-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. In an additional experiment, humans and {GPT}-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 {GPT}-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and {GPT}-4. This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.},

Multilevel analyses were conducted on data that previously documented the benefits of values affirmations on African American students’ grades. The density of African American students who received the intervention in each classroom (i.e., treatment density) was used as an independent predictor of grades. Within a classroom, the greater the density of African American students who participated in the intervention exercise, the higher the grades of all classmates on average, regardless of their race or whether they participated in the intervention exercise. Benefits of treatment density were most pronounced among students with a history of poor performance. Results suggest that the benefits of psychological intervention do not end with the individual. Changed individuals can improve their social environments, and such improvements can benefit others regardless of whether they participated in the intervention.

Both birdsong and spoken language are culturally transmitted across generations, within species-specific constraints that leave room for considerable variation. We review the commonalities and differences between vocal learning bird species and humans, across behavioral, developmental, neuroanatomical, physiological, and genetic levels. We propose that cultural transmission of vocal repertoires is a natural consequence of the evolution of vocal learning and that at least some species-specific universals, as well as species differences in cultural transmission, are due to differences in vocal learning phenotypes, which are shaped by genetic constraints. We suggest that it is the balance between these constraints and features of the social environment that allows cultural learning to propagate. We describe new opportunities for exploring meaningful comparisons of birdsong and human vocal culture.},

We report on communicative behaviours in social and sexual contexts, as found in dyads of humans, non-human primates, non-primate mammals, birds, anurans and insects. We discuss observed instances of rhythm in dyadic interactions, identify knowledge gaps and propose suggestions for future research. We find that most studies on rhythmicity in interactive signals mainly focus on one modality (acoustic or visual) and we suggest more work should be performed on multimodal signals. Although the social functions of interactive rhythms have been fairly well described, developmental research on rhythms used to regulate social interactions is still lacking. Future work should also focus on identifying the exact timing mechanisms involved. Rhythmic signalling behaviours are widespread and critical in regulating social interactions across taxa, but many questions remain unexplored. A multidisciplinary, comparative cross-species approach may help provide answers.

	abstract = {Psychologists and neuroscientists extensively rely on computational models for studying and analyzing the human mind. Traditionally, such computational models have been handdesigned by expert researchers. Two prominent examples are cognitive architectures and Bayesian models of cognition. Although the former requires the specification of a fixed set of computational structures and a definition of how these structures interact with each other, the latter necessitates the commitment to a particular prior and a likelihood function that – in combination with Bayes’ rule – determine the model’s behavior. In recent years, a new framework has established itself as a promising tool for building models of human cognition: the framework of meta-learning. In contrast to the previously mentioned model classes, meta-learned models acquire their inductive biases from experience, that is, by repeatedly interacting with an environment. However, a coherent research program around meta-learned models of cognition is still missing to date. The purpose of this article is to synthesize previous work in this field and establish such a research program. We accomplish this by pointing out that meta-learning can be used to construct Bayes-optimal learning algorithms, allowing us to draw strong connections to the rational analysis of cognition. We then discuss several advantages of the meta-learning framework over traditional methods and reexamine prior work in the context of these new insights.},

	abstract = {This article looks at 20 years of applications of agent-based models ({ABMs}) in sociology and, in particular, their explanatory achievements and methodological insights. These applications have helped sociologists to examine agent interaction in social outcomes and have helped shift analyses away from structural and aggregate factors, to the role of agency. They have improved the realism of the micro-behavioral foundations of sociological models, by complementing analytic modeling and game theory–inspired analyses. Secondly, they have helped us to dissect the role of social structures in constraining individual behavior more precisely than in variable-based sociology. Finally, simulation outcomes have given us a more dynamic view of the interplay between individual behavior and social structures, thus promoting a more evolutionary and process-based approach to social facts. Attention here has been paid to social norms, social influence, and culture dynamics, across different disciplines such as behavioral sciences, complexity science, sociology, and economics. We argue that these applications can help sociology to achieve more rigorous research standards, by promoting a modeling environment and providing tighter cross-disciplinary integration. Recently, certain methodological improvements toward model standardization, replication, and validation have been achieved. As a result, the impact of these models in sociology is expected to grow even more in the future. {WIREs} Comput Stat 2015, 7:284–306. doi: 10.1002/wics.1356 This article is categorized under: Statistical Models {\textgreater} Agent-Based Models Algorithms and Computational Methods {\textgreater} Computational Complexity Data: Types and Structure {\textgreater} Social Networks},

Here we review emerging uses of urban mobility behaviour data, and propose an analytic framework to represent mobility patterns as a temporal bipartite network between people and places. As this network reconfigures over time, analysts can track experienced inequality along three critical dimensions: social mixing with others from specific demographic backgrounds, access to different types of facilities, and spontaneous adaptation to unexpected events, such as epidemics, conflicts or disasters. This framework traces the dynamic, lived experiences of urban inequality and complements prior work on static inequalities experience at home and work.},

Those benefits accrue from a resonance between how they approach questions and the questions they ask. For example, both rely on experiments to explore how individual interactions generate collective phenomena. The paper compares micro-mechanism-driven and macro-pattern-driven {ABM} paradigms and introduces a new research approach—the minimal society paradigm—and a modeling strategy, principle-oriented modeling. This framework integrates {ABM} into psychological research, supporting both theory building through minimal societies and adaptation to specific contexts.

We show that this can be explained by a boundedly rational learning model in which credit is (erroneously) assigned to each input independent of every other.

	abstract = {What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of {NeuroAI} often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for {NeuroAI}, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``{NeuroAI} Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and {\textbackslash}emph\{additionally\} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and {AI} development.},

	abstract = {Human similarity judgments are a powerful supervision signal for machine learning applications based on techniques such as contrastive learning, information retrieval, and model alignment, but classical methods for collecting human similarity judgments are too expensive to be used at scale. Recent methods propose using pre-trained deep neural networks ({DNNs}) to approximate human similarity, but pre-trained {DNNs} may not be available for certain domains (e.g., medical images, low-resource languages) and their performance in approximating human similarity has not been extensively tested. We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains – images, audio, video – and found that there is a large gap in performance between human similarity judgments and pre-trained {DNNs}. To address this gap, we propose a new class of similarity approximation methods based on language. To collect the language data required by these new methods, we also developed and validated a novel adaptive tag collection pipeline. We find that our proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper, in the number of human judgments, than classical methods, but still improve performance over the {DNN}-based methods. Finally, we also develop ‘stacked’ methods that combine language embeddings with {DNN} embeddings, and find that these consistently provide the best approximations for human similarity across all three of our modalities. Based on the results of this comprehensive study, we provide a concise guide for researchers interested in collecting or approximating human similarity data. To accompany this guide, we also release all of the similarity and language data, a total of 206,339 human judgments, that we collected in our experiments, along with a detailed breakdown of all modeling results.},

	abstract = {Determining the extent to which the perceptual world can be recovered from language is a longstanding problem in philosophy and cognitive science. We show that state-of-the-art large language models can unlock new insights into this problem by providing a lower bound on the amount of perceptual information that can be extracted from language. Specifically, we elicit pairwise similarity judgments from {GPT} models across six psychophysical datasets. We show that the judgments are significantly correlated with human data across all domains, recovering well-known representations like the color wheel and pitch spiral. Surprisingly, we find that a model ({GPT}-4) co-trained on vision and language does not necessarily lead to improvements specific to the visual modality, and provides highly correlated predictions with human data irrespective of whether direct visual input is provided or purely textual descriptors. To study the impact of specific languages, we also apply the models to a multilingual color-naming task. We find that {GPT}-4 replicates cross-linguistic variation in English and Russian illuminating the interaction of language and perception.},

Social network topology (what artifacts are available?), selection (which are chosen?), and reproduction (how are they copied?) have all been proposed as key influencing factors. However, prior research has rarely studied them together due to methodological challenges. We address this gap through a controlled naturalistic paradigm whereby participants (N=2,404) are placed in networks and are asked to iteratively choose and sing back melodies from their neighbors. We show that this setting yields melodies that are more complex and more pleasant than those found in the more-studied linear transmission setting, and exhibits robust differences across topologies. Crucially, these differences are diminished when selection or reproduction bias are eliminated, suggesting an interaction between mechanisms. These findings shed light on the interplay of mechanisms underlying the evolution of cultural artifacts.},

	abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ({fNIRS}) promises to be a leading non-invasive neuroimaging method due to its portability and low cost. However, concerns are rising over its inclusivity of all skin tones and hair types (Parker and Ricard, 2022, Webb et al., 2022). Functional {NIRS} relies on direct contact of light-emitting optodes to the scalp, which can be blocked more by longer, darker, and especially curlier hair. Additionally, {NIR} light can be attenuated by melanin, which is accounted for in neither {fNIRS} hardware nor analysis methods. Recent work has shown that overlooking these considerations in other modalities like {EEG} leads to the disproportionate exclusion of individuals with these phenotypes—especially Black people—in both clinical and research literature (Choy, 2020; Bradford et al., 2022; Louis et al., 2023). In this article, we sought to determine if (Jöbsis, 1977) biomedical optics developers and researchers report {fNIRS} performance variability between skin tones and hair textures, (2a) {fNIRS} neuroscience practitioners report phenotypic and demographic details in their articles, and thus, (2b) is a similar pattern of participant exclusion found in {EEG} also present in the {fNIRS} literature. We present a literature review of top Biomedical Optics and Human Neuroscience journals, showing that demographic and phenotypic reporting is unpopular in both {fNIRS} development and neuroscience applications. We conclude with a list of recommendations to the {fNIRS} community including examples of Black researchers addressing these issues head-on, inclusive best practices for {fNIRS} researchers, and recommendations to funding and regulatory bodies to achieve an inclusive neuroscience enterprise in {fNIRS} and beyond.},

	abstract = {Scale invariant neural dynamics are a relatively new but effective means of measuring changes in brain states as a result of varied cognitive load and task difﬁculty. This study tests whether scale invariance (as measured by the Hurst exponent, H) can be used with functional near-infrared spectroscopy ({fNIRS}) to quantify cognitive load, paving the way for scale-invariance to be measured in a variety of real-world settings. We analyzed H extracted from the {fNIRS} time series while participants completed an N-back working memory task. Consistent with what has been demonstrated in {fMRI}, the current results showed that scale-invariance analysis signiﬁcantly differentiated between task and rest periods as calculated from both oxy- ({HbO}) and deoxy-hemoglobin ({HbR}) concentration changes. Results from both channel-averaged H and a multivariate partial least squares approach (Task {PLS}) demonstrated higher H during the 1-back task than the 2-back task. These results were stronger for H derived from {HbR} than from {HbO}. This suggests that scale-free brain states are a robust signature of cognitive load and not limited by the speciﬁc neuroimaging modality employed. Further, as {fNIRS} is relatively portable and robust to motion-related artifacts, these preliminary results shed light on the promising future of measuring cognitive load in real life settings.},

Research in adults has begun to elucidate the psychological mechanisms and neural substrates underlying these learning processes and factors that influence their relative recruitment. However, the developmental trajectory of these evaluative strategies has not been well characterized. In this study, children, adolescents, and adults performed a sequential reinforcement-learning task that enabled estimation of model-based and model-free contributions to choice. Whereas a model-free strategy was apparent in choice behavior across all age groups, a model-based strategy was absent in children, became evident in adolescents, and strengthened in adults. These results suggest that recruitment of model-based valuation systems represents a critical cognitive component underlying the gradual maturation of goal-directed behavior.},

In this review, we examine whether the tuning of model parameters that govern different aspects of learning and decision-making processes vary consistently as a function of age, and what neurocognitive developmental changes may account for differences in these parameter estimates across development. We explore whether patterns of developmental change in these estimates are better described by differences in the extent to which individuals adapt their learning processes to the statistics of different environments, or by more static learning biases that emerge across varied contexts. We focus specifically on learning rates and inverse temperature parameter estimates, and find evidence that from childhood to adulthood, individuals become better at optimally weighting recent outcomes during learning across diverse contexts and less exploratory in their value-based decision-making. We provide recommendations for how these two possibilities — and potential alternative accounts — can be tested more directly to build a cohesive body of research that yields greater insight into the development of core learning processes.},

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own.},

This article explores how research on the adolescent brain can inform the development of biologically based computational models of learning and behavior. We highlight how computational frameworks such as reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks capture key features of adolescent behavior, including shifts in exploration and decision-making strategies. By integrating principles of brain development, such as synaptic pruning and the hierarchical development of neural circuits, computational models can offer insights into how the brain adapts to new experiences and challenges. We argue that studying adolescent brain development not only enhances our understanding of cognition but also provides a valuable framework for refining computational models of brain function. We propose future directions for how adolescent research can inform innovations in computational research to better capture dynamic brain states, individual variability, and risk for psychopathology.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a time during which we transition to independence, explore new activities and begin pursuit of major life goals. Goal-directed learning, in which we learn to perform actions that enable us to obtain desired outcomes, is central to many of these processes. Currently, our understanding of goal-directed learning in adolescence is itself in a state of transition, with the scientific community grappling with inconsistent results. When we examine metrics of goal-directed learning through the second decade of life, we find that many studies agree there are steady gains in performance in the teenage years, but others report that adolescent goal-directed learning is already adult-like, and some find adolescents can outperform adults. To explain the current variability in results, sophisticated experimental designs are being applied to test learning in different contexts. There is also increasing recognition that individuals of different ages and in different states will draw on different neurocognitive systems to support goal-directed learning. Through adoption of more nuanced approaches, we can be better prepared to recognize and harness adolescent strengths and to decipher the purpose (or goals) of adolescence itself.},

	abstract = {Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For {AI} systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce {MuMA}-{ToM}, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. {MuMA}-{ToM} is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In {MuMA}-{ToM}, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated {MuMA}-{ToM} in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent {ToM} model, {LIMP} (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that {LIMP} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., {GPT}-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal {ToM} model, {BIP}-{ALM}.},

Neural patterns from brain regions involved in social perception, mentalization, action observation and sensory processing were extracted. Representational similarity analysis results revealed that several labeled social features (including social interaction, mentalization, the actions of others, characters talking about themselves, talking about others and talking about objects) were represented in the superior temporal gyrus ({STG}) and middle temporal gyrus ({MTG}). The mentalization feature was also represented throughout the theory of mind network, and characters talking about others engaged the temporoparietal junction ({TPJ}), suggesting that listeners may spontaneously infer the mental state of those being talked about. In contrast, we did not observe the action representations in the frontoparietal regions of the action observation network. The current findings indicate that {STG} and {MTG} serve as key regions for social processing, and that listening to characters talk about others elicits spontaneous mental state inference in {TPJ} during natural movie viewing.},

These results provide the first evidence that activity in the {STS} is reinstated in response to specific social content and that its reactivation underlies our ability to remember others’ interactions.

            Humans effortlessly recognize social interactions from visual input. Attempts to model this ability have typically relied on generative inverse planning models, which make predictions by inverting a generative model of agents’ interactions based on their inferred goals, suggesting humans use a similar process of mental inference to recognize interactions. However, growing behavioral and neuroscience evidence suggests that recognizing social interactions is a visual process, separate from complex mental state inference. Yet despite their success in other domains, visual neural network models have been unable to reproduce human-like interaction recognition. We hypothesize that humans rely on relational visual information in particular, and develop a relational, graph neural network model, {SocialGNN}. Unlike prior models, {SocialGNN} accurately predicts human interaction judgments across both animated and natural videos. These results suggest that humans can make complex social interaction judgments without an explicit model of the social and physical world, and that structured, relational visual representations are key to this behavior.},

	abstract = {Seeing social touch triggers a strong social-affective response that involves multiple brain networks, including visual, social perceptual, and somatosensory systems. Previous studies have identified the specific functional role of each system, but little is known about the speed and directionality of the information flow. Is this information extracted via the social perceptual system or from simulation from somatosensory cortex? To address this, we examined the spatiotemporal neural processing of observed touch. Twenty-one human participants (seven males) watched 500-ms video clips showing social and nonsocial touch during electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recording. Visual and social-affective features were rapidly extracted in the brain, beginning at 90 and 150 ms after video onset, respectively. Combining the {EEG} data with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data from our prior study with the same stimuli reveals that neural information first arises in early visual cortex ({EVC}), then in the temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus ({TPJ}/{pSTS}), and finally in the somatosensory cortex. {EVC} and {TPJ}/{pSTS} uniquely explain {EEG} neural patterns, while somatosensory cortex does not contribute to {EEG} patterns alone, suggesting that social-affective information may flow from {TPJ}/{pSTS} to somatosensory cortex. Together, these findings show that social touch is processed quickly, within the timeframe of feedforward visual processes, and that the social-affective meaning of touch is first extracted by a social perceptual pathway. Such rapid processing of social touch may be vital to its effective use during social interaction.

              Seeing physical contact between people evokes a strong social-emotional response. Previous research has identified the brain systems responsible for this response, but little is known about how quickly and in what direction the information flows. We demonstrated that the brain processes the social-emotional meaning of observed touch quickly, starting as early as 150 ms after the stimulus onset. By combining electroencephalogram ({EEG}) data with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data, we show for the first time that the social-affective meaning of touch is first extracted by a social perceptual pathway and followed by the later involvement of somatosensory simulation. This rapid processing of touch through the social perceptual route may play a pivotal role in effective usage of touch in social communication and interaction.},

We normed and quantified a large range of visual, action-related, and social-affective features across the stimulus sets. Using a cross-validated variance partitioning analysis, we found that social-affective features predicted similarity judgments better than, and independently of, visual and action features in both behavioral experiments. Next, we conducted an electroencephalography experiment, which revealed a sustained correlation between neural responses to videos and their behavioral similarity. Visual, action, and social-affective features predicted neural patterns at early, intermediate, and late stages, respectively, during this behaviorally relevant time window. Together, these findings show that social-affective features are important for perceiving naturalistic actions and are extracted at the final stage of a temporal gradient in the brain.},

Using simple stimuli, previous studies have shown that social interactions are selectively processed in the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), but prior work with movies has suggested that social interactions are processed in the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}), part of the theory of mind network. It remains unknown to what extent social interaction selectivity is observed in real world stimuli when controlling for other covarying perceptual and social information, such as faces, voices, and theory of mind. The current study utilizes a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) movie paradigm and advanced machine learning methods to uncover the brain mechanisms uniquely underlying naturalistic social interaction perception. We analyzed two publicly available {fMRI} datasets, collected while both male and female human participants (n = 17 and 18) watched two diﬀerent commercial movies in the {MRI} scanner. By performing voxelwise encoding and variance partitioning analyses, we found that broad social-aﬀective features predict neural responses in social brain regions, including the {STS} and {mPFC}. However, only the {STS} showed robust and unique selectivity speciﬁcally to social interactions, independent from other covarying features. This selectivity was observed across two separate {fMRI} datasets. These ﬁndings suggest that naturalistic social interaction perception recruits dedicated neural circuity in the {STS}, separate from the theory of mind network, and is a critical dimension of human social understanding.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models trained on computer vision tasks are widely considered the most successful models of human vision to date. The majority of work that supports this idea evaluates how accurately these models predict brain and behavioral responses to static images of objects and natural scenes. Real-world vision, however, is highly dynamic, and far less work has focused on evaluating the accuracy of deep learning models in predicting responses to stimuli that move, and that involve more complicated, higher-order phenomena like social interactions. Here, we present a dataset of natural videos and captions involving complex multi-agent interactions, and we benchmark 350+ image, video, and language models on behavioral and neural responses to the videos. As with prior work, we ﬁnd that many vision models reach the noise ceiling in predicting visual scene features and responses along the ventral visual stream (often considered the primary neural substrate of object and scene recognition). In contrast, image models poorly predict human action and social interaction ratings and neural responses in the lateral stream (a neural pathway increasingly theorized as specializing in dynamic, social vision). Language models (given human sentence captions of the videos) predict action and social ratings better than either image or video models, but they still perform poorly at predicting neural responses in the lateral stream. Together these results identify a major gap in {AI}’s ability to match human social vision and highlight the importance of studying vision in dynamic, natural contexts.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical work has argued that in addition to the classical ventral (what) and dorsal (where/how) visual streams, there is a third visual stream on the lateral surface of the brain specialized for processing social information. Like visual representations in the ventral and dorsal streams, representations in the lateral stream are thought to be hierarchically organized. However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated the organization of naturalistic, social visual content in the lateral stream. To address this question, we curated a naturalistic stimulus set of 250 3-s videos of two people engaged in everyday actions. Each clip was richly annotated for its low-level visual features, mid-level scene and object properties, visual social primitives (including the distance between people and the extent to which they were facing), and high-level information about social interactions and affective content. Using a condition-rich {fMRI} experiment and a within-subject encoding model approach, we found that low-level visual features are represented in early visual cortex ({EVC}) and middle temporal ({MT}) area, mid-level visual social features in extrastriate body area ({EBA}) and lateral occipital complex ({LOC}), and high-level social interaction information along the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}). Communicative interactions, in particular, explained unique variance in regions of the {STS} after accounting for variance explained by all other labeled features. Taken together, these results provide support for representation of increasingly abstract social visual content—consistent with hierarchical organization—along the lateral visual stream and suggest that recognizing communicative actions may be a key computational goal of the lateral visual pathway.},

However, the neural computations underlying this ability remain largely unknown. Is social interaction recognition a rapid feedforward process or a slower post-perceptual inference? Here we used magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) decoding to address this question. Subjects in the {MEG} viewed snapshots of visually matched real-world scenes containing a pair of people who were either engaged in a social interaction or acting independently. The presence versus absence of a social interaction could be read out from subjects’ {MEG} data spontaneously, even while subjects performed an orthogonal task. This readout generalized across different people and scenes, revealing abstract representations of social interactions in the human brain. These representations, however, did not come online until quite late, at 300 ms after image onset, well after feedforward visual processes. In a second experiment, we found that social interaction readout still occurred at this same late latency even when subjects performed an explicit task detecting social interactions. We further showed that {MEG} responses distinguished between different types of social interactions (mutual gaze vs joint attention) even later, around 500 ms after image onset. Taken together, these results suggest that the human brain spontaneously extracts information about others’ social interactions, but does so slowly, likely relying on iterative top-down computations.},

Here we showcase a data-driven reverse correlation method for visualizing any perceptually-derived stereotype at the individual level. We show that our method (1) produces photorealistic and reliable results related to a broad range of judgments, (2) produces valid, psychologically-aligned representations of what individuals are imagining “in their mind’s eye”, and (3) is capable of capturing visual representations sensitive enough to examine context-dependent categories (e.g., a trustworthy individual to babysit your children vs. to fix your car).

	abstract = {Real-world communication frequently requires language producers to address more than one comprehender at once, yet most psycholinguistic research focuses on one-on-one communication. As the audience size grows, interlocutors face new challenges that do not arise in dyads. They must consider multiple perspectives and weigh multiple sources of feedback to build shared understanding. Here, we ask which properties of the group’s interaction structure facilitate successful communication. We used a repeated reference game paradigm in which directors instructed between one and five matchers to choose specific targets out of a set of abstract figures. Across 313 games (N = 1,319 participants), we manipulated several key constraints on the group’s interaction, including the amount of feedback that matchers could give to directors and the availability of peer interaction between matchers. Across groups of different sizes and interaction constraints, describers produced increasingly efficient utterances and matchers made increasingly accurate selections. Critically, however, we found that smaller groups and groups with less-constrained interaction structures (“thick channels”) showed stronger convergence to group-specific conventions than large groups with constrained interaction structures (“thin channels”), which struggled with convention formation. Overall, these results shed light on the core structural factors that enable communication to thrive in larger groups.},

	abstract = {Consider the process of collective decision-making, in which a group of individuals interactively select a preferred outcome from among a universe of alternatives. In this context, "representation" is the activity of making an individual's preferences present in the process via participation by a proxy agent -- i.e. their "representative". To this end, learned models of human behavior have the potential to fill this role, with practical implications for multi-agent scenario studies and mechanism design. In this work, we investigate the possibility of training {\textbackslash}textit\{language agents\} to behave in the capacity of representatives of human agents, appropriately expressing the preferences of those individuals whom they stand for. First, we formalize the setting of {\textbackslash}textit\{collective decision-making\} -- as the episodic process of interaction between a group of agents and a decision mechanism. On this basis, we then formalize the problem of {\textbackslash}textit\{digital representation\} -- as the simulation of an agent's behavior to yield equivalent outcomes from the mechanism. Finally, we conduct an empirical case study in the setting of {\textbackslash}textit\{consensus-finding\} among diverse humans, and demonstrate the feasibility of fine-tuning large language models to act as digital representatives.},

            Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are increasingly used to model human vision due to their high object categorization capabilities and general correspondence with human brain responses. Here we evaluate the performance of 14 different {CNNs} compared with human {fMRI} responses to natural and artificial images using representational similarity analysis. Despite the presence of some {CNN}-brain correspondence and {CNNs}’ impressive ability to fully capture lower level visual representation of real-world objects, we show that {CNNs} do not fully capture higher level visual representations of real-world objects, nor those of artificial objects, either at lower or higher levels of visual representations. The latter is particularly critical, as the processing of both real-world and artificial visual stimuli engages the same neural circuits. We report similar results regardless of differences in {CNN} architecture, training, or the presence of recurrent processing. This indicates some fundamental differences exist in how the brain and {CNNs} represent visual information.},

Indeed, studies of spontaneous activity tend to focus predominantly on intrinsic neural patterns (for example, resting-state networks). Taking a ‘representation-rich’ approach bridges the gap between cognition and resting-state communities: this approach relies on decoding task-related representations from spontaneous neural activity, allowing quantification of the representational content and rich dynamics of such activity. For example, if we know the neural representation of an episodic memory, we can decode its subsequent replay during rest. We argue that such an approach advances cognitive research beyond a focus on immediate task demand and provides insight into the functional relevance of the intrinsic neural pattern (for example, the default mode network). This in turn enables a greater integration between human and animal neuroscience, facilitating experimental testing of theoretical accounts of intrinsic activity, and opening new avenues of research in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Theory of mind ({ToM}; Premack \& Woodruff, 1978) broadly refers to humans’ ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions.

We design a Theory of Mind neural network – a {ToMnet} – which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents’ behaviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents’ characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the {ToMnet} to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic {ToM} tasks such as the “{SallyAnne}” test (Wimmer \& Perner, 1983; {BaronCohen} et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world. We argue that this system – which autonomously learns how to model other agents in its world – is an important step forward for developing multi-agent {AI} systems, for building intermediating technology for machine-human interaction, and for advancing the progress on interpretable {AI}.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep {RL}) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a "fast" reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the {RNN}, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose ("slow") {RL} algorithm. The {RNN} receives all information a typical {RL} algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process ({MDP}). The activations of the {RNN} store the state of the "fast" {RL} algorithm on the current (previously unseen) {MDP}. We evaluate {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite {MDPs}. After {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ is trained, its performance on new {MDPs} is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},

Some categorizations seem to be made explicitly based on rules whereas other categorizations seem to be made implicitly based on similarity. Several theories posit either that multiple learning systems are involved in categorization or that categorization is carried out by a single learning system. The multiple-system approach assumes that people learn new categories via an explicit verbal system and an implicit procedural system. The single-system approach assumes that categories are learned by a single cognitive system that relies on stimulus similarity and selective attention. In this Review, we first provide an overview of the primary theories and models in the field of categorization and highlight the assumptions and operating characteristics of each. We then discuss evidence from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, computational modelling and comparative psychology to determine which approach is best supported. We conclude that the debate between a multiple-system theory and a single-system approach has not yet been resolved and suggest avenues for future research to create a robust theory that accounts for category learning beyond the laboratory and beyond the confines of the classification learning paradigm.},

This benchmark was proposed to test general competency of {RL} algorithms. Previous work has achieved good average performance by doing outstandingly well on many games of the set, but very poorly in several of the most challenging games. We propose Agent57, the first deep {RL} agent that outperforms the standard human benchmark on all 57 Atari games.

We propose an adaptive mechanism to choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process.

	title = {Teacher–student neural coupling during teaching and learning},
	abstract = {Human communication is remarkably versatile, enabling teachers to share highly abstracted and novel information with their students. What neural processes enable such transfer of information across brains during naturalistic teaching and learning? Here, a teacher was scanned in functional magnetic resonance imaging while giving an oral lecture with slides on a scientific topic followed by a review lecture. Students were then scanned while watching either the intact Lecture and Review (N = 20) or a temporally scrambled version of the lecture (N = 20). Using intersubject correlation, we observed widespread Teacher–Student neural coupling spanning sensory cortex and language regions along the superior temporal sulcus as well as higher-level regions including posterior medial cortex ({PMC}), superior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Teacher–student alignment in higher-level areas was not observed when learning was disrupted by temporally scrambling the lecture. Moreover, teacher–student coupling in {PMC} was significantly correlated with learning: the more closely the student’s brain mirrored the teacher’s brain, the more the student improved their learning score. Together, these results suggest that the alignment of neural responses between teacher and students may reflect effective communication of complex information across brains in classroom settings.},

	abstract = {We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning ({RL}), which has experienced significant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decision-making tasks. However, one challenge in the study of {RL} is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make {RL} tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of {RL} have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing {RL} systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efficiently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in {RL} may function as part of an integrated learning system.},

            Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual’s ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another’s actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one’s willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.},

For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings.

              Individual differences in brain functional organization track a range of traits, symptoms and behaviours
              1–12
              . So far, work modelling linear brain–phenotype relationships has assumed that a single such relationship generalizes across all individuals, but models do not work equally well in all participants
              13,14
              . A better understanding of in whom models fail and why is crucial to revealing robust, useful and unbiased brain–phenotype relationships. To this end, here we related brain activity to phenotype using predictive models—trained and tested on independent data to ensure generalizability
              15
              —and examined model failure. We applied this data-driven approach to a range of neurocognitive measures in a new, clinically and demographically heterogeneous dataset, with the results replicated in two independent, publicly available datasets
              16,17
              . Across all three datasets, we find that models reflect not unitary cognitive constructs, but rather neurocognitive scores intertwined with sociodemographic and clinical covariates; that is, models reflect stereotypical profiles, and fail when applied to individuals who defy them.

	abstract = {How does psychology vary across human societies? The fundamental social motives framework adopts an evolutionary approach to capture the broad range of human social goals within a taxonomy of ancestrally recurring threats and opportunities. These motives—self-protection, disease avoidance, affiliation, status, mate acquisition, mate retention, and kin care—are high in fitness relevance and everyday salience, yet understudied cross-culturally. Here, we gathered data on these motives in 42 countries (N = 15,915) in two cross-sectional waves, including 19 countries (N = 10,907) for which data were gathered in both waves. Wave 1 was collected from mid-2016 through late 2019 (32 countries, N = 8,998; 3,302 male, 5,585 female; Mage = 24.43, {SD} = 7.91). Wave 2 was collected from April through November 2020, during the {COVID}-19 pandemic (29 countries, N = 6,917; 2,249 male, 4,218 female; Mage = 28.59, {SD} = 11.31). These data can be used to assess differences and similarities in people’s fundamental social motives both across and within cultures, at different time points, and in relation to other commonly studied cultural indicators and outcomes.},

With new communities constantly emerging and serving as ideological birthplaces, battlegrounds, and bunkers, it is critical to develop a framework for understanding worldviews and ideological distinction. Most existing work, however, takes a predetermined view based on political polarization: the “right vs. left” dichotomy of U.S. politics. In reality, both political polarization – and worldviews more broadly – transcend one-dimensional difference, and deserve a more complete analysis. Extending the ability of word embedding models to capture the semantic and cultural characteristics of their training corpora, we propose a novel method for discovering the multifaceted ideological and worldview characteristics of communities. Using over 1B comments collected from the largest communities on Reddit.com representing 40\% of Reddit activity, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of this approach to uncover complex ideological differences across multiple axes of polarization.},

Such data in the form of opinions, emotions, and views about services, politics, and products are characterized by unstructured format. End users, business industries, and politicians are highly influenced by sentiments of the people expressed on social media platforms. Therefore, extracting, analyzing, summarizing, and predicting the sentiments from large unstructured data needs automated sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is an automated process of extracting the opinionated from data and classifying the sentiments as positive, negative, and neutral. Lack of enough labeled data for sentiment analysis is one of the crucial challenges in natural language processing. Deep learning has emanated as one of the highly sought-after solutions to address this challenge due to automated and hierarchical learning capability inherently supported by deep learning models. Considering the application of deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis, this chapter aims to put forth taxonomy of traits to be considered for deep learning-based sentiment analysis and demystify the role of deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis.},

Drawing on tens of millions of research papers and patents across the life sciences, physical sciences and patented inventions, and using a hypergraph model that predicts realized combinations of research contents (article keywords) and contexts (cited journals), here we show that surprise in terms of unexpected combinations of contents and contexts predicts outsized impact (within the top 10\% of citations). These surprising advances emerge across, rather than within researchers or teams—most commonly when scientists from one field publish problem-solving results to an audience from a distant field. Our approach characterizes the frontier of science and technology as a complex hypergraph drawn from high-dimensional embeddings of research contents and contexts, and offers a measure of path-breaking surprise in science and technology.},

Practical and research applications of artificial intelligence tools have sometimes been limited by problematic biases (such as racism or sexism), which are often treated as uniform properties of the models. We show that the "algorithmic bias" within one such tool -- the {GPT}-3 language model -- is instead both fine-grained and demographically correlated, meaning that proper conditioning will cause it to accurately emulate response distributions from a wide variety of human subgroups. We term this property "algorithmic fidelity" and explore its extent in {GPT}-3. We create "silicon samples" by conditioning the model on thousands of socio-demographic backstories from real human participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the information contained in {GPT}-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and reflects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and socio-cultural context that characterize human attitudes. We suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic fidelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of humans and society across a variety of disciplines.},

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a highdimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

We present here the Natural Object Dataset ({NOD}), a large-scale {fMRI} dataset containing responses to 57,120 naturalistic images from 30 participants. {NOD} strives for a balance between sampling variation between individuals and sampling variation between stimuli. This enables {NOD} to be utilized not only for determining whether an observation is generalizable across many individuals, but also for testing whether a response pattern is generalized to a variety of naturalistic stimuli.

To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (Nyounger = 26, ages 18–34; Nolder = 24, ages 63–80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network ({DMN}) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced {DMN} connectivity with the temporoparietal junction ({TPJ}) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others.},

To understand how the brain builds these representations, we conducted 2 {fMRI} experiments in which subjects viewed humans interacting with objects, noninteracting human–object pairs, and isolated humans and objects. A number of visual regions process features of human–object interactions, including object identity information in the lateral occipital complex ({LOC}) and parahippocampal place area ({PPA}), and human pose information in the extrastriate body area ({EBA}) and posterior superior temporal sulcus ({pSTS}). Representations of human–object interactions in some regions, such as the posterior {PPA} (retinotopic maps {PHC}1 and {PHC}2) are well predicted by a simple linear combination of the response to object and pose information. Other regions, however, especially {pSTS}, exhibit representations for human–object interaction categories that are not predicted by their individual components, indicating that they encode human–object interactions as more than the sum of their parts. These results reveal the distributed networks underlying the emergent representation of human–object interactions necessary for social perception.},

Like visual representations in the ventral and dorsal streams, representations in the lateral stream are thought to be hierarchically organized. However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated the organization of naturalistic, social visual content in the lateral stream. To address this question, we curated a naturalistic stimulus set of 250 3-s videos of two people engaged in everyday actions. Each clip was richly annotated for its low-level visual features, mid-level scene and object properties, visual social primitives (including the distance between people and the extent to which they were facing), and high-level information about social interactions and affective content. Using a condition-rich {fMRI} experiment and a within-subject encoding model approach, we found that low-level visual features are represented in early visual cortex ({EVC}) and middle temporal ({MT}) area, mid-level visual social features in extrastriate body area ({EBA}) and lateral occipital complex ({LOC}), and high-level social interaction information along the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}). Communicative interactions, in particular, explained unique variance in regions of the {STS} after accounting for variance explained by all other labeled features. Taken together, these results provide support for representation of increasingly abstract social visual content—consistent with hierarchical organization—along the lateral visual stream and suggest that recognizing communicative actions may be a key computational goal of the lateral visual pathway.},

However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated the organization of naturalistic, social visual content in the lateral stream. To address this question, we curated a naturalistic stimulus set of 250 3-s videos of two people engaged in everyday actions. Each clip was richly annotated for its low-level visual features, mid-level scene and object properties, visual social primitives (including the distance between people and the extent to which they were facing), and high-level information about social interactions and affective content. Using a condition-rich {fMRI} experiment and a within-subject encoding model approach, we found that low-level visual features are represented in early visual cortex ({EVC}) and middle temporal ({MT}) area, mid-level visual social features in extrastriate body area ({EBA}) and lateral occipital complex ({LOC}), and high-level social interaction information along the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}). Communicative interactions, in particular, explained unique variance in regions of the {STS} after accounting for variance explained by all other labeled features. Taken together, these results provide support for representation of increasingly abstract social visual content—consistent with hierarchical organization—along the lateral visual stream and suggest that recognizing communicative actions may be a key computational goal of the lateral visual pathway.},

Data points can enter a deep neural network as “sparse” information, using only their native encoding (e.g., word presence or absence; pixel hue, saturation and intensity; audio frequency and amplitude), but sent into the model in the context of surrounding elements. With such sparse data, deep neural networks can learn a “dense” representation that projects data to fewer dimensions, which can be used to reconstruct, generalize and learn intrinsic structure from data. As we show in the next chapter, these learned representations become the basis for comparing and combining diverse data. Alternatively, when faced with computational constraints or a lack of data, dimension-reduction approaches can be used to reduce sparse data to dense representations before being fed into a deep model. In this chapter, we present options to input sparse and dense data into models for a wide range of domains, from text to audio-visual to graph learning and beyond. At each stage, we discuss derived “data” or data representations deep learning models output for analysis or as input to subsequent models.},

	abstract = {Social relationships change across the lifespan as social networks narrow and motivational priorities shift. These changes may affect, or reflect, differences in how older adults make decisions related to processing social and non-social rewards. While we have shown initial evidence that older adults have a blunted response to some features of social reward, further work in larger samples is needed to replicate our results and probe the extent to which age-related differences translate to real world consequences, such as financial exploitation. To address this gap, we are conducting a 5-year study funded by the National Institute on Aging ({NIH} R01-{AG}067011). Over the course of the funding period (2021–2026), this study seeks to: 1) characterize neural responses to social rewards across adulthood; 2) relate those responses to risk for financial exploitation and sociodemographic factors tied to risk; and 3) examine changes in risk for financial exploitation over time in healthy and vulnerable groups of older adults. This paper describes the preliminary release of data for the larger study. Adults (N = 114; 40 male / 70 female / 4 other or non-binary; 21–80 years of age M = 42.78, {SD} = 17.13) were recruited from the community to undergo multi-echo {fMRI} while completing tasks that measure brain function during social reward and decision making. Tasks probe neural response to social reward (e.g., peer vs. monetary feedback) and social context and closeness (e.g., sharing a monetary reward with a friend compared to a stranger). Neural response to social decision making is probed via economic trust and ultimatum games. Functional data are complimented by a T1 weighted anatomical scan and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI}) to enable tractography and assess neurite orientation dispersion and density. Overall, this dataset has extensive potential for re-use, including leveraging multimodal neuroimaging data, within subject measures of {fMRI} data from different tasks – data features that are rarely seen in an adult lifespan dataset. Finally, the functional data will allow for developmentally sensitive cross-sectional analyses of differences in brain response to nuanced differences in reward contexts and outcomes (e.g., monetary vs. social; sharing winnings with a friend vs. stranger; stranger vs. computer).},

We projected patterns of cortical and striatal functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space and examined how regions expanded and contracted along the manifold during learning. During early learning, we found that several sensorimotor areas in the Dorsal Attention Network exhibited increased covariance with areas of the salience/ventral attention network and reduced covariance with areas of the default mode network ({DMN}). During late learning, these effects reversed, with sensorimotor areas now exhibiting increased covariance with {DMN} areas. However, areas in posteromedial cortex showed the opposite pattern across learning phases, with its connectivity suggesting a role in coordinating activity across different networks over time.

            Everyone is different. Understanding the unique way an individual perceives the world is a fundamental goal of psychology and brain science. Using novel methods for analyzing functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data, we show that each person viewing a set of objects represents the objects uniquely in his or her brain. Moreover, given an individual’s measured brain-activity patterns, idiosyncrasies in his or her perception of the similarities among the objects can be predicted. Prediction accuracy is modest using current technology. However, our results demonstrate that {fMRI} has the power to reveal individually unique representations of particular objects in the human brain. The novel method might help us understand the biological substrate of individual experience in mental health and disease.

            The unique way in which each of us perceives the world must arise from our brain representations. If brain imaging could reveal an individual’s unique mental representation, it could help us understand the biological substrate of our individual experiential worlds in mental health and disease. However, imaging studies of object vision have focused on commonalities between individuals rather than individual differences and on category averages rather than representations of particular objects. Here we investigate the individually unique component of brain representations of particular objects with functional {MRI} ({fMRI}). Subjects were presented with unfamiliar and personally meaningful object images while we measured their brain activity on two separate days. We characterized the representational geometry by the dissimilarity matrix of activity patterns elicited by particular object images. The representational geometry remained stable across scanning days and was unique in each individual in early visual cortex and human inferior temporal cortex ({hIT}). The {hIT} representation predicted perceived similarity as reflected in dissimilarity judgments. Importantly, {hIT} predicted the individually unique component of the judgments when the objects were personally meaningful. Our results suggest that {hIT} brain representational idiosyncrasies accessible to {fMRI} are expressed in an individual's perceptual judgments. The unique way each of us perceives the world thus might reflect the individually unique representation in high-level visual areas.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to deﬁne the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., {fMRI} and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices ({RDMs}), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis ({RSA}), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing {RDMs}. We demonstrate {RSA} by relating representations of visual objects as measured with {fMRI} in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The {RDMs} are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of {RSA}, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more uniﬁed systems neuroscience.},

In the context of neuroimaging, mass-univariate analyses and other multivariate analyses can provide information on what and where information is represented but have limitations in their ability to address how information is represented. Social neuroscience is a field that can particularly benefit from incorporating {RSA} techniques to explore hypotheses regarding the representation of multidimensional data, how representations can predict behavior, how representations differ between groups and how multimodal data can be compared to inform theories.

It was unresponsive to physical pain (emotion–pain = 92\% discriminative accuracy), demonstrating that it is not a representation of generalized arousal or salience. The signature was comprised of mesoscale patterns spanning multiple cortical and subcortical systems, with no single system necessary or sufficient for predicting experience. Furthermore, it was not reducible to activity in traditional “emotion-related” regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) or resting-state networks (e.g., “salience,” “default mode”).

              As Harper Lee tells us in
              To Kill a Mockingbird
              , “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb in his skin and walk around in it.” Classic theories in social psychology argue that this purported process of social simulation provides the foundations for self-regulation. In light of this, we investigated the neural processes whereby humans may regulate their affective responses to an event by simulating the way others would respond to it. Our results suggest that during perspective-taking, behavioral and neural signatures of negative affect indeed mimic the presumed affective state of others. Furthermore, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex—a region implicated in mental state inference—may orchestrate this affective simulation process.
            
          , 
            Can taking the perspective of other people modify our own affective responses to stimuli? To address this question, we examined the neurobiological mechanisms supporting the ability to take another person’s perspective and thereby emotionally experience the world as they would. We measured participants’ neural activity as they attempted to predict the emotional responses of two individuals that differed in terms of their proneness to experience negative affect. Results showed that behavioral and neural signatures of negative affect (amygdala activity and a distributed multivoxel pattern reflecting affective negativity) simulated the presumed affective state of the target person. Furthermore, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC})—a region implicated in mental state inference—exhibited a perspective-dependent pattern of connectivity with the amygdala, and the multivoxel pattern of activity within the {mPFC} differentiated between the two targets. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on perspective-taking and self-regulation.},

To interpret the implications of others’ actions correctly, learners must understand the people generating the data. Most models of learning, however, assume that data are randomly collected facts about the world and cannot explain how social contexts influence learning. We provide a Bayesian analysis of learning from knowledgeable others, which formalizes how learners may use a person’s actions and goals to make inferences about the actor’s knowledge about the world. We illustrate this framework using two examples from causal learning and conclude by discussing the implications for cognition, social reasoning, and cognitive development.},

	abstract = {Although Darwin insisted that human intelligence could be fully explained by the theory of evolution, the codiscoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that abstract intelligence was of no use to ancestral humans and could only be explained by intelligent design. Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the “cognitive niche.” This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.},

Humans have relatively bigger brains and more computing power than other animals, and this allows us to figure out how to live in a wide range of environments. Here we argue that humans may be smarter than other creatures, but none of us is nearly smart enough to acquire all of the information necessary to survive in any single habitat. In even the simplest foraging societies, people depend on a vast array of tools, detailed bodies of local knowledge, and complex social arrangements and often do not understand why these tools, beliefs, and behaviors are adaptive. We owe our success to our uniquely developed ability to learn from others. This capacity enables humans to gradually accumulate information across generations and develop well-adapted tools, beliefs, and practices that are too complex for any single individual to invent during their lifetime.},

It has been argued that this phenomenon of repetition suppression is related to increases in processing fluency or implicit memory. However, repetition of a visual stimulus can also be considered in terms of the similarity of the pattern of neural activity elicited at each exposure—a measure that has recently been linked to explicit memory. Despite the popularity of each of these measures, direct comparisons between the two have been limited, and the extent to which they differentially (or similarly) relate to behavioral measures of memory has not been clearly established. In the present study, we compared repetition suppression and pattern similarity as predictors of both implicit and explicit memory. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 20 participants while they viewed and categorized repeated presentations of scenes. Repetition priming (facilitated categorization across repetitions) was used as a measure of implicit memory, and subsequent scene recognition was used as a measure of explicit memory. We found that repetition priming was predicted by repetition suppression in prefrontal, parietal, and occipitotemporal regions; however, repetition priming was not predicted by pattern similarity. In contrast, subsequent explicit memory was predicted by pattern similarity (across repetitions) in some of the same occipitotemporal regions that exhibited a relationship between priming and repetition suppression; however, explicit memory was not related to repetition suppression. This striking double dissociation indicates that repetition suppression and pattern similarity differentially track implicit and explicit learning.},

The {MVPA} and univariate results did identify some overlapping regions in whole brain analyses. However, an analysis of consistency revealed that in many regions the effect size estimates obtained from {MVPA} and univariate analysis were uncorrelated. Moreover, comparison of sensitivity showed a general trend towards greater sensitivity to task manipulations by {MVPA} compared to univariate analysis. These results demonstrate that {MVPA} methods may provide a different view of the functional organization of mental processing compared to univariate analysis, wherein {MVPA} is more sensitive to distributed coding of information whereas univariate analysis is more sensitive to global engagement in ongoing tasks.

Past work on this topic, however, is limited to static networks of speciﬁc topologies of interest.
Purpose: This study aims to explore whether dynamic networks, where players can choose their partners, perform better in the graph coloring game. Research Design: We replicate the conventional graph coloring game experiment and introduce a new version where players can change their network neighbors. Study Sample and Data Collection: We recruited over 300 human participants for the experiment, with each session involving an average of 20 participants per network.
Results: We found that dynamic networks that allow agents to switch network neighbors works more effectively and efﬁciently in solving coloring conﬂicts than static networks in which people are allowed to change color alone. The networks in the experiment updated by people’s selection of neighbors tend to evolve to a state similar in structure to the small-world network characterized by short path distance and high triadic clustering.
Conclusion: We argue that a self-organized approach demonstrated by our experiment can inspire search of behavioral strategies and network topologies for solving coordination problems in social networks.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., {fMRI} and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices ({RDMs}), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis ({RSA}), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing {RDMs}. We demonstrate {RSA} by relating representations of visual objects as measured with {fMRI} in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The {RDMs} are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of {RSA}, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The focus of this study was to use item response theory to develop a 60-item, {IPIP}-based measure of the Five-Factor Model ({FFM}) that provides equal representation of the {FFM} facets and to test the reliability and convergent and criterion validity of this measure compared to the {NEO} Five Factor Inventory ({NEO}-{FFI}). In an undergraduate sample (n = 359), scores from the {NEO}-{FFI} and {IPIP}–{NEO}–60 demonstrated good reliability and convergent validity with the {NEO} {PI}–R and {IPIP}–{NEO}–300. Additionally, across criterion variables in the undergraduate sample as well as a community-based sample (n = 757), the {NEO}-{FFI} and {IPIP}–{NEO}–60 demonstrated similar nomological networks across a wide range of external variables ({rICC} = .96). Finally, as expected, in an {MTurk} sample the {IPIP}–{NEO}–60 demonstrated advantages over the Big Five Inventory–2 (Soto \& John, 2017; n = 342) with regard to the Agreeableness domain content. The results suggest strong reliability and validity of the {IPIP}–{NEO}–60 scores.},

The data was validated with standard methods that have been used for existing picture datasets. This is the first dataset to provide naming norms, and translation equivalents, for such a variety of languages; as such, it will be of particular value to psycholinguists and other interested researchers.

A sample of 605 participants completed an online survey, in which they were asked to rate either the valence or the arousal of each stimulus, by using a Self-Assessment Manikin. The Environmental Risk to Humans database associates the emotional reactions to these visual stimuli, together with the demographics of the sample (e.g., gender, age, marital status, income, previous experience of natural disasters).

To bridge this gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed personal information questionnaires. Our analysis shows that age negatively affects knowledge space navigation performance, while multilingualism enhances it. Under time pressure, participants’ performance improves across trials and males outperform females, an effect not observed in games without time pressure. In our experiment, successful route-finding is usually not related to abilities of innovative exploration of routes. Our results underline the importance of age, multilingualism and time constraint in the knowledge space navigation.},

While this requires knowledge of how people are connected, networks are too large to have first-hand experience with every possible route between individuals. How, then, are people able to accurately track information flow through social networks? Here we find that people immediately cache abstract knowledge about social network structure as they learn who is friends with whom, which enables the identification of efficient routes between remotely connected individuals. These cognitive maps of social networks, which are built while learning, are then reshaped through overnight rest. During these extended periods of rest, a replay-like mechanism helps to make these maps increasingly abstract, which privileges improvements in social navigation accuracy for the longest communication paths that span distinct communities within the network. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the sophisticated mental representations humans use for social navigation.},

Quantifying the driving risk cognition of passengers is a basic step toward this end. This study reports the creation of an {fNIRS} dataset focusing on the prefrontal cortex activity in fourteen types of highly automated driving scenarios. This dataset considers age, sex and driving experience factors and contains the data collected from an 8-channel {fNIRS} device and the data of driving scenarios. The dataset provides data support for distinguishing the driving risk in highly automated driving scenarios via brain-computer interface systems, and it also provides the possibility of preventing potential hazards in some scenarios, in which risk remains at a high value for an extended period, before hazard occurs.},

	abstract = {Behavioural and neuroimaging research has shown that older adults are less sensitive to financial losses compared to younger adults. Yet relatively less is known about age-related differences in social decisions and social reward processing. As part of a pilot study, we collected behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data from 50 participants (Younger: N = 26, ages 18–34 years; Older: N = 24, ages 63–80 years) who completed three tasks in the scanner: an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (computer, stranger, friend) as the investee; a card-guessing task with monetary gains and losses shared with three partners (computer, stranger, friend); and an ultimatum game as responder to three anonymous proposers (computer, age-similar adults, age-dissimilar adults). We also collected B0 field maps and high-resolution structural images (T1-weighted and T2-weighted images). These data could be reused to answer questions about moment-to-moment variability in {fMRI} signal, representational similarity between tasks, and brain structure.},

However, the incorporation of physiological data remains constrained. Emotion recognition with physiological data shows promising results in controlled experiments but lacks generalization to real-world settings. To address this, we present G-{REx}, a dataset for real-world affective computing. We collected physiological data (photoplethysmography and electrodermal activity) using a wrist-worn device during long-duration movie sessions. Emotion annotations were retrospectively performed on segments with elevated physiological responses. The dataset includes over 31 movie sessions, totaling 380 h+ of data from 190+ subjects. The data were collected in a group setting, which can give further context to emotion recognition systems. Our setup aims to be easily replicable in any real-life scenario, facilitating the collection of large datasets for novel affective computing systems.},

Word ratings on these different semantic dimensions can help investigate the behavioral and neural impacts of semantic dimensions on language processes and build computational representations of language meaning according to the semantic space of the human cognitive system. Existing semantic rating databases provide ratings for hundreds to thousands of words, which can hardly support a comprehensive semantic analysis of natural texts or speech. This article reports a large database, the Six Semantic Dimension Database ({SSDD}), which contains subjective ratings for 17,940 commonly used Chinese words on six major semantic dimensions: vision, motor, socialness, emotion, time, and space. Furthermore, using computational models to learn the mapping relations between subjective ratings and word embeddings, we include the estimated semantic ratings for 1,427,992 Chinese and 1,515,633 English words in the {SSDD}. The {SSDD} will aid studies on natural language processing, text analysis, and semantic representation in the brain.},

This social science survey invited participants around the world to complete a series of moral and psychological measures and public health attitudes about {COVID}-19 during an early phase of the {COVID}-19 pandemic (between April and June 2020). The survey included seven broad categories of questions: {COVID}-19 beliefs and compliance behaviours; identity and social attitudes; ideology; health and well-being; moral beliefs and motivation; personality traits; and demographic variables.

Recent work analyzing massive datasets advances our understanding of popularity, but one major gap remains: To precisely quantify the relationship between the popularity of an online item and the external promotions it receives. This work supplies the missing link between exogenous inputs from public social media platforms, such as Twitter, and endogenous responses within the content platform, such as {YouTube}. We develop a novel mathematical model, the Hawkes intensity process, which can explain the complex popularity history of each video according to its type of content, network of diﬀusion, and sensitivity to promotion. Our model supplies a prototypical description of videos, called an endo-exo map. This map explains popularity as the result of an extrinsic factor – the amount of promotions from the outside world that the video receives, acting upon two intrinsic factors – sensitivity to promotion, and inherent virality. We use this model to forecast future popularity given promotions on a large 5-months feed of the most-tweeted videos, and found it to lower the average error by 28.6\% from approaches based on popularity history. Finally, we can identify videos that have a high potential to become viral, as well as those for which promotions will have hardly any eﬀect.},

A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world1–6. However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep. Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.},

However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. We now draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep {RL}) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, beneﬁting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, {RL}2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the {RNN}, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) {RL} algorithm. The {RNN} receives all information a typical {RL} algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination ﬂags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process ({MDP}). The activations of the {RNN} store the state of the “fast” {RL} algorithm on the current (previously unseen) {MDP}. We evaluate {RL}2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-armed bandit problems and ﬁnite {MDPs}. After {RL}2 is trained, its performance on new {MDPs} is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the largescale side, we test {RL}2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},

	abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep {RL} methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the {RL} setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one {RL} algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate {RL} procedure. This second, learned {RL} algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-{RL}. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

One particular, newly uncovered, trend is that lyrics of popular songs have become increasingly simple over time. Why might this be? Here, we test the idea that increasing lyrical simplicity is accompanied by a widening array of novel song choices. We do so by using six decades (1958–2016) of popular music in the United States (N = 14,661 songs), controlling for multiple well-studied ecological and cultural factors plausibly linked to shifts in lyrical simplicity (e.g., resource availability, pathogen prevalence, rising individualism). In years when more novel song choices were produced, the average lyrical simplicity of the songs entering U.S. billboard charts was greater. This cross-temporal relationship was robust when controlling for a range of cultural and ecological factors and employing multiverse analyses to control for potentially confounding influence of temporal autocorrelation. Finally, simpler songs entering the charts were more successful, reaching higher chart positions, especially in years when more novel songs were produced. The present results suggest that cultural transmission depends on the amount of novel choices in the information landscape.},

            Which features of music are universal and which are culture-specific? Why? These questions are important for understanding why humans make music but have rarely been scientifically tested. We used musical classification techniques and statistical tools to analyze a global set of 304 music recordings, finding no absolute universals but dozens of statistical universals. These include not only commonly cited features related to pitch and rhythm but also domains such as social context and interrelationships between musical features. We speculate that group coordination is the common aspect unifying the cross-cultural structural regularities of human music, with implications for the study of music evolution.
          , 
            Music has been called “the universal language of mankind.” Although contemporary theories of music evolution often invoke various musical universals, the existence of such universals has been disputed for decades and has never been empirically demonstrated. Here we combine a music-classification scheme with statistical analyses, including phylogenetic comparative methods, to examine a well-sampled global set of 304 music recordings. Our analyses reveal no absolute universals but strong support for many statistical universals that are consistent across all nine geographic regions sampled. These universals include 18 musical features that are common individually as well as a network of 10 features that are commonly associated with one another. They span not only features related to pitch and rhythm that are often cited as putative universals but also rarely cited domains including performance style and social context. These cross-cultural structural regularities of human music may relate to roles in facilitating group coordination and cohesion, as exemplified by the universal tendency to sing, play percussion instruments, and dance to simple, repetitive music in groups. Our findings highlight the need for scientists studying music evolution to expand the range of musical cultures and musical features under consideration. The statistical universals we identified represent important candidates for future investigation.},

We use the geometric model to determine the optimal number of modes for five historical epochs via unsupervised learning and apply the probabilistic model to infer the characteristics of the modes. Our results show that the inference of four modes is most plausible in the Renaissance, that two modes–corresponding to major and minor–are most appropriate in the Baroque and Classical eras, whereas no clear separation into distinct modes is found for the 19th century.},

	abstract = {1 {IntroductionWhen} a sweeping {COVID}-19 pandemic forced cultural venues, schools, and social hangouts into hibernation in early 2020, music life relocated to the digital world. On social media platforms like {YouTube}, Facebook, Twitter, and {TikTok}, sofas and balconies took center stage for musical performances presented as live-streamed concerts and recorded videos. Amateurs and professional musicians alike embraced digital formats and innovated novel genres of corona-themed music. Adapting the well-known “musicking” term from cultural musicology (Small, 1999), we will characterize the diverse practices of listening to, playing, dancing to, composing, rehearsing, improvising, discussing, exploring, and innovating musical products during lockdown with explicit or implicit reference to the novel coronavirus and/or pandemic life circumstances as “corona-musicking.” By extension, audiovisual products of such corona-musicking behavior will be defined collectively as “coronamusic.” To best facilitate future work, these definitions are intentionally broad and minimally exclusive (cf. Small, 1999). This study aims to establish the {CORONAMUSIC} {DATABASE}–a crowdsourced corpus of links to coronamusic videos and news media reports (https://osf.io/y7z28/). This constitutes the first readily accessible and searchable resource for researchers from all disciplines with an interest in documenting and investigating the musical dynamics underlying the pandemic.Because establishing a typology of coronamusic lies beyond the scope of a data report, we will restrict ourselves to mentioning examples here. Across the globe, topical tunes were composed, and humorous {COVID}-19 lyrics were invented for well-known songs, resulting in thought-provoking contrafacta some of which were designed to process an unfamiliar everyday life in safe sonic environments. Reminiscent of previous outbreaks such as “The Plague of Saint Charles” hitting Milan in 1576 (Chiu, 2020), daily routines involving balcony singing and joint, steadfast clapping for healthcare workers accompanied by loud vocalizations, whistling, and percussive use of kitchen utensils (Taylor, 2020) offered musical ways of imposing structure upon chaos and expressing gratitude through ritualistic behavior (Imber-Black, 2020). When music teaching moved online (de Bruin, 2021; Philippe et al., 2020), musical skills and social cohesion were nurtured through lockdown-compatible, video-conference-based rehearsal formats (Daffern et al., 2021; Datta , 2020; {MacDonald} et al., 2021). Governmental and private organizations commissioned and disseminated health information videos promoting hand-washing (Thampi et al., 2020) and similar protective measures through musical mnemonics and dance challenges. Deprived of opportunities for live concert attendance and clubbing, some people participated in virtual raves (Palamar \&amp; Acosta, 2020). Corona-musicking behaviors were documented through splitscreen videos flooding the social media landscape under hashtags like \#coronasongs, \#quarantunes, \#covidance, \#pandemix, and \#songsofcomfort. The diversity and complexity of coronamusic repertoire call for descriptive research efforts with an epistemologically open mindset, ideally liberated from traditional disciplinary boundaries.An important question concerns when and how much people engaged with music during lockdown. Music listening through audio-based streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify) decreased considerably, most likely due to changes in music-accompanied behaviors like public commuting and gym exercise (Sim et al., 2020). The same report found dramatic surges in video-based services (e.g., {YouTube}). Some platform-neutral, self-report measures indeed suggest increased music listening during lockdown (Cabedo-Mas et al., 2020; Fink et al., 2021; Mas-Herrero et al., 2020; see, however, Krause et al., 2020). Qualitative findings support these lifestyle-related changes in music consumption, including the switch to video-based streaming (Carlson et al., 2021). While the trend of creating and sharing corona-themed musical content persisted throughout 2020, corona-musicking may have been most prominent during the early months of the pandemic (i.e., March‒May). This would be consistent with findings that music listening may have decreased slightly about two months after lockdown began (Krause et al., 2020). Despite these objective and subjective reports of pandemic musicking at home, empirical data on online coronamusic sharing remain scarce.Scientific knowledge on intrinsic motivations for pursuing corona-musicking is gaining territory. Across 11 countries, Granot et al. (2021) found that musical engagement provided the most effective, physically distanced leisure activity for achieving wellbeing goals. Mas-Herrero et al. (2020) showed that people in Italy, Spain, and {USA} picked music-related activities over entertainment (e.g., watching series, movies, reading books) and physical exercise as the most helpful coping mechanism for pandemic-induced distress. The hours spent on musical activities during (but not before) lockdown were negatively associated with anxiety and depression, and this effect was mediated by individual reward sensitivity. Other reports indicate that nostalgic music listening—which is known to induce positive emotions towards one’s own autobiographical memories in general (Sugimori et al., 2020) and during lockdown (Gibbs \&amp; Egermann, 2021)—was especially prominent (Yeung, 2020). Greatest repertoire specificity was achieved by another large-scale, multi-country study by Fink et al. (2021) whose results assigned particular significance to corona-themed music. Specifically one’s interest in how other people used coronamusic to respond to the crisis most strongly predicted how much musical engagement assisted emotional and social coping. Consistent with the social surrogacy theory (Sch\&\#228;fer \&amp; Eerola, 2020), people experiencing positive emotions used music listening and making as a proxy for social interaction. Relatedly, others have speculated that sharing emotions through music has enhanced our ability to tolerate pandemic-induced, transient uncertainty states (Sarasso et al., 2021).Given the humorous nature and lockdown-related topics of much coronamusic, these recent findings seem consistent with research on motivations for media use more broadly. Eden et al. (2020) found that pandemic-induced anxiety was associated with greater media use overall with a particular prominence of content designed for reframing pertinent stressors pursued with an eudaimonic motivation to tackle existential questions of purpose in life and moral values. Approach coping behaviors and related motivations were in turn associated with positive emotions and psychological flourishing. Tackling anxiety through humoristic coping was, furthermore, associated with good mental health.In addition to social media and fiction, people heavily consumed news during lockdown (Fink et al., 2021). A non-negligible proportion of {COVID}-19-related news dealt with aspects of coronamusicking, thus making news media informative for a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. A recent report from European Parliamentary Research Service describes how today’s media outlets are subject to growing commercial pressure acting on a globalized playing field where information spreads at unseen speeds and competition for attention is fierce (Fletcher \&amp; Jenkins, 2019). The resulting breaking news culture leaves limited space for critical fact-checking and promotes sensationalist journalism and self-fulfilling filter bubbles entailing an imminent risk of accidental dissemination of insufficiently verified information; these tendencies were only exacerbated during the pandemic (Ali, 2020). Anecdotal observations reveal that much media coverage of coronamusic initiatives emphasized positive emotions like joy, humor, and togetherness (Taylor, 2020). This potential positive affective bias contrasts starkly with the predominantly negative sentiments dominating other areas of the public sphere (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). This invites nuanced empirical substantiation for topics and sentiment in coronamusic-themed news coverage. Therefore, in addition to {COVID}-19-themed music videos from social media, a separate subset comprising news media coverage of coronamusicking was included in the database.In light of coronamusic’s novelty and significance in the everyday lives and psychological coping behaviors of the global population, a corona-themed musical data resource designed to enable scientific study is needed. Despite the release of large datasets surveying psychological wellbeing (e.g., Yamada et al., 2021) and media use (e.g., reading habits: Salmer\&\#243;n et al., 2020), to our knowledge, no public corpora document musical content used and produced during the societal lockdowns of 2020. Several desirable features spring to mind. First, while many prior music video-related datasets have been text corpora comprising {YouTube} user comments (e.g., Bassignana et al., 2020; Uryupina et al., 2014; see, however, Osborn et al., 2020), the {CORONAMUSIC} {DATABASE} contains links to the videos themselves. Second, to facilitate capturing the diversity in cultures, sentiments, musical genres, and instrumentation, crowdsourcing was used (Hossain \&amp; Kauranen, 2015). However, because sampling relied on personal networks and because all gathered data needed to be interpretable and codable by our own research team–with all its inherent cultural biases–an emphasis on Europe and the English-speaking world (i.e., {USA}, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) was unavoidable. Finally, to ensure a sizable corpus, real-time crowdsourcing was supplemented with systematic retrospective sampling.2 {MethodsA} database of links to {COVID}-19-themed music videos and news media content representative of the coronamusic phenomenon was created via crowdsourcing (Section 2.1). The video-based subset was subsequently extended with retrospectively sampled {YouTube} videos to ensure a substantial daily representation for the first two lockdown months. While audio-only content (e.g., {SoundCloud}) was permitted, we focused on videos because music consumption partly migrated from audio- to video-based platforms during {COVID}-19 lockdown (Sim et al., 2020; Carlson et al., 2021). During recent years, music videos have been the top-ranking content genre on {YouTube} (Liikanen \&amp; Salovaara, 2015), which is optimized for user content creation and has become the most popular music streaming service in some countries (Sohn, 2018). All data entries were systematically coded by the research team to enhance searchability (Section 2.2).2.1 Sampling2.1.1 Crowdsourced {samplingOn} 26th March 2020, an openly accessible Google Sheet was created inviting the public to supply {URL} links to videos, media coverage, hashtags, online concerts, and other resources in any language deemed to exemplify how music was used during the novel coronavirus pandemic. On 3rd April 2020, an online survey was launched on the {SurveyXact} platform (Ramb\&\#248;ll Management Consulting, Denmark) to facilitate content collection.To estimate the reach of recruitment efforts, statistics were sourced from Twitter. Specifically, tweets from {NCH}’s personal account included an initial announcement of the Google Sheet with a clarifying follow-up tweet on 26 March, an announcement of the {SurveyXact} questionnaire with two follow-up tweets on 3 April, a follow-up announcement in Danish on 20 April, and a closing notice on 23 July. A total of 30,242 impressions (i.e., number of views by anyone), 1,033 engagements (i.e., number of interactions generated), 118 retweets, and 113 likes were obtained. Further unquantified activity is expected from retweets and shares on other platforms (e.g., Facebook). Additionally, all contributors were encouraged to share survey links within their own network, and the database was advertised to research colleagues at virtual launching events for the {MUSICOVID} network with \&gt;250 global attendance on 19 May. Finally, the overall research project was promoted with survey links on the researchers’ university webpages and by national news media in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and The Netherlands.[{INSERT} {FIGURE} 1 {APPROXIMATELY} {HERE}]2.1.2 Retrospective {samplingCrowdsourced} videos had the highest representation during March-April 2020. This coincided reasonably well both with the peak in the use of “music {AND} corona” as a Google search term (sourced on 12 February 2021) and the upsurge in lockdown restrictions across the represented countries (Figure 1A). Yet, to facilitate future longitudinal studies, further {YouTube} videos were sampled retrospectively ensuring a minimum of five items per calendar date during the initial two lockdown months. Retrospective sampling employed the ‘googlesearch’ library in Python (script available on {OSF}: https://osf.io/y7z28/). We decided to reproduce the cultural biases of the original dataset by focusing on countries represented with ≥15 crowdsourced videos ({USA}: 133; {UK}: 42; Denmark: 32; Israel: 27; Italy: 25; Australia: 15), but excluded Israel due to lacking Hebrew coding competence. The first day with non-zero stringency indices across all five countries (27 February) was chosen as starting date. Because Google does not permit single-day searches and requires country/region specification, overlapping two-day windows were used, and the five target countries were included as search locations one by one (using the ‘gl’ tag). For each window, 25 candidate {URLs} were sourced for each country. For 27 February, for example, the following search term was applied (adhering to the current upper word limit for Google searches): site:youtube.com before:2020-02-28 after:2020-02-27 (music {OR} musica {OR} musik {OR} musique {OR} muziek {OR} song {OR} tune {OR} lied {OR} liedje {OR} chanson {OR} canzone {OR} sang) {AND} (covid {OR} covid19 {OR} ‘covid-19’ {OR} coronavirus {OR} corona {OR} ‘sars-cov-2’ {OR} \#quarantunes {OR} \#covidance {OR} \#coronasongs {OR} \#coronamusic {OR} \#{TogetherAtHome} {OR} \#{StayHome} {OR} \#Pandemix {OR} \#{COVered}19 {OR} \#gratitunes)Thus, a music-related term was required in combination with a coronavirus-themed term or one of the nine most common crowdsourced hashtags. In addition to the target-country languages, Dutch, German, and French terms were included as these languages were represented with ≥10 crowdsourced videos from Netherlands (14), Germany (15), France (13), and Canada (11). The Python script was run from an {HP} machine (Windows 10) in Oslo (i.e., neutral territory outside the five target countries), on 31 October at 8:00 {CEST} and concluded {\textasciitilde}24 hours later.To produce a single prioritized list of candidate {URLs} for each date, rows were selected from the top of the generated output using a randomly drawn vector of country labels weighted according to the crowdsourced country distribution while avoiding duplicate {URLs}. 2.2 Coding2.2.1 {VideosFor} characterizing and classifying videos, a coding scheme was developed. Specifically, 15 videos were first randomly selected for exploratory content analysis by all authors independently. Codes based on ad-hoc categories from Google Sheet/{SurveyXact} were subsequently compared to check for inconsistencies, add and merge categories, and refine definitions when necessary. The final coding scheme agreed upon by all team members comprised:● {ID}: Arbitrarily assigned unique indices.● Category: Sub-corpus (i.e., video, media, other).● Source: Sampling origin (i.e., {GoogleSheet}, {SurveyXact}, Retrospective)● {URLs}: {URL}(s) locating the item.● Title: Title sourced online or submitted by contributor.● {PublicationDate}: Date stamp for publication.● {SoMePlatform}: Social media platform (e.g., {YouTube}, Facebook, Twitter, {TikTok}, Instagram, {SoundCloud}, Vimeo).● {JointMusicking}*: Whether \&gt;1 person is visibly performing together.● {OrigCovidSong}*: Whether the performer(s) have composed the music themselves during the coronavirus crisis (regardless whether the lyrics were unambiguously {COVID}-related). ● {OrigCovidLyrics}*: Whether lyrics make reference to the coronavirus situation.● Movement*: Whether movement is featured and/or encouraged in the video, including dancing, yoga, and prominent moving around while performing, to an extent beyond what is minimally required for successful musical performance/attendance.● {HealthInfo}*: Whether instructions like “stay home,” “wash hands,” “wear a mask” occur explicitly or implicitly.● Conflict*: Whether content (i.e., lyrics, visual gestures, spoken utterances, musical features) refers to conflict–e.g., between nations, fellow citizens, or cohabitants.● Country: Performers’ nationality and/or residence country.● {LyricsLanguage}: Language(s) of lyrics.● Setting**: Setting(s) of music making/visual content (e.g., outside, home, kitchen, balcony, venue).● Genre**: Musical genre(s) represented, using at least one of the 23 categories from Revised Short Test of Music Preferences ({STOMP}-R; Rentfrow \&amp; Gosling, 2003) along with voluntary free-text labels.● Emotions**: Emotions represented or evoked. Free-text responses supplemented nine prompts generated through author consensus (anger, being moved, gratitude, grief/sadness, happiness, humor, loneliness, togetherness). Consensus was reached during coding scheme development and was heavily informed by the authors’ continual watching of coronamusic videos during the pandemic.● Features**: All-inclusive category for any other characteristic features (e.g., splitscreen, for kids, balcony performance, patriotism).There were three variable types: (a) factual variables (no asterisk), (b) binary variables (single asterisk), and (c) open-coded variables (double asterisks). Whereas binary variables were dichotomous, open-coded variables used inclusive coding allowing for multiple values and {NAs} without enforcing mutual exclusivity (e.g., “home” and “kitchen” settings co-existed for the same item). Two further variables indicated date ({RetroSampleDate}) and geolocation ({RetroSampleCountry}) for retrospective sampling. “Features” labels were developed and refined during group meetings throughout the coding process as more videos were viewed (and re-coded when necessary).All video {URLs} were randomly assigned a first and second coder from amongst the authors (see {FirstCoder} and {SecondCoder} columns). After all coders had independently coded their assigned videos, conflicts for binary variables were resolved during bilateral virtual meetings whereas open-coded variables were combined across coders. A small subset of unresolved conflicts and principled issues were determined in plenum. This systematic procedure ensured that the vast majority of factual and binary codings achieved 100\% inter-rater agreement between two coders whereas the remaining more ambiguous codings always had support from at least three authors.Final editorial proofreading and streamlining was performed to optimize discoverability; typos were amended, spellings were unified, text was converted to lowercase, nouns were singularized, non-essential {URL} parameters were removed, and similar categories were merged (e.g., “rehearsal” replaced “choir rehearsal;” “venue” replaced “stage” and “concert hall;” “outside” replaced “outdoors;” “patriotism” replaced “nationalism”). Genre designations constituting parts of {STOMP}-R categories were re-assigned to these (e.g., “dance/electronica” replaced “dance;” “soul/R\&amp;B” replaced “R\&amp;B” and “soul”). The full project group was consulted when doubt arose.During coding, duplicates, dysfunctional links, and ineligible submissions were removed, and some videos were re-classified as media or other (see Sections 2.2.2-2.2.3). Video compilations curated by news media sources (e.g., with printed text) were only re-classified if a reporter was featured visually or via voice-over. Coronamusic-themed links not including videos or news reports were designated as other. Because codings could differ between items with identical audio but distinct video, those were kept. 2.2.2 Media A coding scheme was developed for news media content using a procedure similar to that described in Section 2.2.1. {SoMePlatform}, {JointMusicking}, {OrigCovidSong}, {OrigCovidLyrics}, {LyricsLanguage}, and Genre were excluded due to limited relevance. Country was redefined as “countries of media platform and journalist(s) reporting.” All other video variables were included. Five media-specific variables were added:● {MediaPlatform}: Name of news media source.● {MediaFormat}: Format(s) used (i.e., {writtenDigital}, {writtenPrint}, audio, video).● {MediaLanguage}: Language of writing or narrator speech.● {EmbeddedExternalVideo}*: Whether external video content (e.g., {YouTube}) is embedded.● {MusicMakerProfessionalism}**: Professional status of music makers described/depicted (amateur and/or prof).Media items comprised factual, binary (*), and open-ended (**) variables and were subject to dual coding with conflict resolution and editorial proofreading as described above. No retrospective sampling was performed.2.2.3 Other (concerts, playlists, etc.)Coronamusic-related items from crowdsourcing whose content met the inclusion criteria for neither video nor media content were assigned to a separate “other” category coded by a single individual, exclusively using factual variables. This third sub-corpus comprised playlists of recorded live-streams and home concerts, free access to digital concert halls and opera houses, online music festivals, virtual choirs/ensembles etc.3 Descriptive {statisticsThe} final {CORONAMUSIC} {DATABASE} contains 465 video items (Google Sheet = 247; {SurveyXact} = 130; Retrospective = 88), 254 media items (Google Sheet = 197; {SurveyXact} = 57), and 62 other items (Google Sheet = 57; {SurveyXact} = 5), published between 8 February and 27 July 2020. All sub-corpora are accessible as separate Excel/{CSV} files at https://osf.io/y7z28/ and can be explored via our {ShinyApp} (https://dana-and-monsters.shinyapps.io/corona-music-database/). Figure 2 and its accompanying legend provide an overview with tentative observations of key quantitative and qualitative variables.[{INSERT} {FIGURE} 2 {APPROXIMATELY} {HERE}]4 Limitations and future {directionsSharing} music enables people to connect with others (Papinczak et al., 2015). During the {COVID}-19 lockdown, pandemic-themed, nostalgic, escapist, and humoristic media were used strategically for diverse coping goals (Eden et al., 2020). The {CORONAMUSIC} {DATABASE} documents and exemplifies how music sharing on social media may have contributed to these media types.This corpus suffers from methodological limitations. First, sampling was biased towards wealthy, industrialized, Western democracies with advanced technological infrastructures. Second, research colleagues may be overrepresented due to snowball recruitment through the authors’ own social media accounts. Third, although, unfortunately, retrospective sampling was restricted by the upper word limit allowed in Google searches, it is not inconceivable that the selected hashtags, terms, and languages may have skewed the results. Fourth, codings were necessarily subjective. While evaluative codings may be verified to control for experimenter bias, many limitations are inherent to anonymous crowdsourcing (Hossain \&amp; Kauranen, 2015). Fifth, because the nine emotion prompts were derived from author consensus rather than any particular theoretical framework, future research may need to reassess the labels. Sixth and finally, our coding scheme makes no attempt to distinguish between truly music-structural and extra-musical features and emotions. Whenever humor, patriotism, conflict, or togetherness are identified, for example, users may need to reinterpret and/or reclassify database entries to suit their individualized needs.Future researchers may develop this database into a systematic typology of coronamusic, identifying and characterizing key subgenres like health songs, splitscreen performances, contrafacta, and original coronasongs. Its direct and derived content may become subject to musical, acoustical, video-based, or text-based analysis to answer questions about nostalgia (Yeung, 2020), humor (Bischetti et al., 2021), positive sentiment (Bhat et al., 2020), alongside other pertinent topics. Teachers and historians may draw examples from this resource.Capitalizing on ingrained psychological coping mechanisms (Fink et al., 2021), the coronamusic phenomenon of 2020 illustrates how humans use music to cope through societal crises. These processes may underlie the sociocultural evolution of music itself (Savage, 2019). Since the world was less interconnected and digitalized during prior wars and pandemics, knowledge gained through coronamusic research may be novel and help inform policy-making in human health and wellbeing.},

	abstract = {Popular music is a key cultural expression that has captured listeners' attention for ages. Many of the structural regularities underlying musical discourse are yet to be discovered and, accordingly, their historical evolution remains formally unknown. Here we unveil a number of patterns and metrics characterizing the generic usage of primary musical facets such as pitch, timbre and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than fifty years. However, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of pitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette and the growing loudness levels. This suggests that our perception of the new would be rooted on these changing characteristics. Hence, an old tune could perfectly sound novel and fashionable, provided that it consisted of common harmonic progressions, changed the instrumentation and increased the average loudness.},

	abstract = {Music sampling is a common practice among hip-hop and electronic producers that has played a critical role in the development of particular subgenres. Artists preferentially sample drum breaks, and previous studies have suggested that these may be culturally transmitted. With the advent of digital sampling technologies and social media the modes of cultural transmission may have shifted, and music communities may have become decoupled from geography. The aim of the current study was to determine whether drum breaks are culturally transmitted through musical collaboration networks, and to identify the factors driving the evolution of these networks. Using network-based diffusion analysis we found strong evidence for the cultural transmission of drum breaks via collaboration between artists, and identified several demographic variables that bias transmission. Additionally, using network evolution methods we found evidence that the structure of the collaboration network is no longer biased by geographic proximity after the year 2000, and that gender disparity has relaxed over the same period. Despite the delocalization of communities by the internet, collaboration remains a key transmission mode of music sampling traditions. The results of this study provide valuable insight into how demographic biases shape cultural transmission in complex networks, and how the evolution of these networks has shifted in the digital age.},

	abstract = {This review offers an accessible primer to social neuroscientists interested in neural networks. It begins by providing an overview of key concepts in deep learning. It then discusses three ways neural networks can be useful to social neuroscientists: (i) building statistical models to predict behavior from brain activity; (ii) quantifying naturalistic stimuli and social interactions; and (iii) generating cognitive models of social brain function. These applications have the potential to enhance the clinical value of neuroimaging and improve the generalizability of social neuroscience research. We also discuss the significant practical challenges, theoretical limitations and ethical issues faced by deep learning. If the field can successfully navigate these hazards, we believe that artificial neural networks may prove indispensable for the next stage of the field’s development: deep social neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) is a framework of particular importance to psychology, neuroscience and machine learning. Interactions between these fields, as promoted through the common hub of {RL}, has facilitated paradigm shifts that relate multiple levels of analysis in a singular framework (for example, relating dopamine function to a computationally defined {RL} signal). Recently, more sophisticated {RL} algorithms have been proposed to better account for human learning, and in particular its oft-documented reliance on two separable systems: a model-based ({MB}) system and a model-free ({MF}) system. However, along with many benefits, this dichotomous lens can distort questions, and may contribute to an unnecessarily narrow perspective on learning and decision-making. Here, we outline some of the consequences that come from overconfidently mapping algorithms, such as {MB} versus {MF} {RL}, with putative cognitive processes. We argue that the field is well positioned to move beyond simplistic dichotomies, and we propose a means of refocusing research questions towards the rich and complex components that comprise learning and decision-making.},

We consider a hierarchical architecture that exploits the computational efficiency of habitual control to select goals while preserving the flexibility of planning to achieve those goals. We formalize this mechanism in a reinforcement learning setting, illustrate its costs and benefits, and experimentally demonstrate its spontaneous application in a sequential decision-making task.},

	abstract = {The recently developed ‘two-step’ behavioural task promises to differentiate model-based from model-free reinforcement learning, while generating neurophysiologically-friendly decision datasets with parametric variation of decision variables. These desirable features have prompted its widespread adoption. Here, we analyse the interactions between a range of different strategies and the structure of transitions and outcomes in order to examine constraints on what can be learned from behavioural performance. The task involves a trade-off between the need for stochasticity, to allow strategies to be discriminated, and a need for determinism, so that it is worth subjects’ investment of effort to exploit the contingencies optimally. We show through simulation that under certain conditions model-free strategies can masquerade as being model-based. We first show that seemingly innocuous modifications to the task structure can induce correlations between action values at the start of the trial and the subsequent trial events in such a way that analysis based on comparing successive trials can lead to erroneous conclusions. We confirm the power of a suggested correction to the analysis that can alleviate this problem. We then consider model-free reinforcement learning strategies that exploit correlations between where rewards are obtained and which actions have high expected value. These generate behaviour that appears model-based under these, and also more sophisticated, analyses. Exploiting the full potential of the two-step task as a tool for behavioural neuroscience requires an understanding of these issues.},

Data from two-stage decision tasks have seemingly shown that human behaviour is driven by both processes operating in parallel. However, in this study, we show that more detailed task instructions lead participants to make primarily model-based choices that have little, if any, simple model-free influence. We also demonstrate that behaviour in the two-stage task may falsely appear to be driven by a combination of simple model-free and model-based learning if purely model-based agents form inaccurate models of the task because of misconceptions. Furthermore, we report evidence that many participants do misconceive the task in important ways. Overall, we argue that humans formulate a wide variety of learning models. Consequently, the simple dichotomy of model-free versus model-based learning is inadequate to explain behaviour in the two-stage task and connections between reward learning, habit formation and compulsivity.},

In this registered report, we put these theories to test using large online samples, dimensional analyses, and computational modelling.

Next, I survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories: dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive approach to empirical research, and that the beneﬁts of a deeper engagement with complexity will be substantial.},

How do people approximate the complexities of the external world with simplified internal representations that generalize to novel examples or situations? Theories suggest that internal representations could be determined by decision boundaries that discriminate between alternatives, or by distance measurements against prototypes and individual exemplars. Each provide advantages and drawbacks for generalization. We therefore developed theoretical models that leverage both discriminative and distance components to form internal representations via action-reward feedback. We then developed three latent-state learning tasks to test how humans use goal-oriented discrimination attention and prototypes/exemplar representations. The majority of participants attended to both goal-relevant discriminative features and the covariance of features within a prototype. A minority of participants relied only on the discriminative feature. Behaviour of all participants could be captured by parameterizing a model combining prototype representations with goal-oriented discriminative attention.},

First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents’ demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits.

First, the left {vTPJ} and {lATL} showed sensitivity to sentences only when the sentences conveyed social meaning; second, these regions showed persistent social-semantic-selective activity after the linguistic stimuli disappeared.

Using phylogenetic analysis and admixture inference, we revealed a north–south gradient of lexical differences that probably resulted from historical migrations. Furthermore, we quantified extensive horizontal language transfers and pinpointed central China as a dialectal melting pot. Integrating genetic data from 30,408 Han Chinese individuals, we compared the lexical and genetic landscapes across 26 provinces. Our results support a hybrid model where demic diffusion predominantly impacts central China, while cultural diffusion and language assimilation occur in southwestern and coastal regions, respectively.

In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, Agent-Based Modeling ({ABM}) began gaining popularity and represents a departure from the more classical simulation approaches. This departure, its recent development and its increasing application by non-traditional simulation disciplines indicates the need to continuously assess the current state of {ABM} and identify opportunities for improvement. To begin to satisfy this need, we surveyed and collected data from 279 articles from 92 unique publication outlets in which the authors had constructed and analyzed an agent-based model. From this large data set we establish the current practice of {ABM} in terms of year of publication, ﬁeld of study, simulation software used, purpose of the simulation, acceptable validation criteria, validation techniques and complete description of the simulation. Based on the current practice we discuss six improvements needed to advance {ABM} as an analysis tool. These improvements include the development of {ABM} speciﬁc tools that are independent of software, the development of {ABM} as an independent discipline with a common language that extends across domains, the establishment of expectations for {ABM} that match their intended purposes, the requirement of complete descriptions of the simulation so others can independently replicate the results, the requirement that all models be completely validated and the development and application of statistical and non-statistical validation techniques speciﬁcally for {ABM}.},

Two core features of this research have the potential to prove valuable in strengthening theoretical frameworks in the health and social sciences: the idea that there is a fundamental trade-off between reproduction and health; and that environmental influences are important in determining how life histories develop. However, the literature on human life histories has increasingly travelled away from its origins in biology, and become conceptually diverse. For example, there are differences of opinion between evolutionary researchers about the extent to which behavioural traits associate with life history traits to form ‘life history strategies’. Here, I review the different approaches to human life histories from evolutionary anthropologists, developmental psychologists and personality psychologists, in order to assess the evidence for human ‘life history strategies’. While there is precedent in biology for the argument that some behavioural traits, notably risk-taking behaviour, may be linked in predictable ways with life history traits, there is little theoretical or empirical justification for including a very wide range of behavioural traits in a ‘life history strategy’. Given the potential of life history approaches to provide a powerful theoretical framework for understanding human health and behaviour, I then recommend productive ways forward for the field: 1) greater focus on the life history trade-offs which underlie proposed strategies; 2) greater precision when using the language of life history theory and life history strategies; 3) collecting more empirical data, from a diverse range of populations, on linkages between life history traits, behavioural traits and the environment, including the underlying mechanisms which generate these linkages; and 4) greater integration with the social and health sciences.},

Instead of passively retaining information, {WM} reorganizes complex sequences into hierarchically embedded chunks to overcome capacity limits and facilitate flexible behaviour. Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying hierarchical reorganization in {WM}, we performed two electroencephalography and one magnetoencephalography experiments, wherein humans retain in {WM} a temporal sequence of items, that is, syllables, which are organized into chunks, that is, multisyllabic words. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional sequence is represented by two-dimensional neural representational geometry in {WM} arising from left prefrontal and temporoparietal regions, with separate dimensions encoding item position within a chunk and chunk position in the sequence. Critically, this two-dimensional geometry is observed consistently in different experimental settings, even during tasks not encouraging hierarchical reorganization in {WM} and correlates with {WM} behaviour. Overall, these findings strongly support that complex sequences are reorganized into factorized multidimensional neural representational geometry in {WM}, which also speaks to general structure-based organizational principles given {WM}’s involvement in many cognitive functions.},

            Separate research streams have identified synchrony and arousal as two factors that might contribute to the effects of human rituals on social cohesion and cooperation. But no research has manipulated these variables in the field to investigate their causal – and potentially interactive – effects on prosocial behaviour. Across four experimental sessions involving large samples of strangers, we manipulated the synchronous and physiologically arousing affordances of a group marching task within a sports stadium. We observed participants’ subsequent movement, grouping, and cooperation via a camera hidden in the stadium’s roof. Synchrony and arousal both showed main effects, predicting larger groups, tighter clustering, and more cooperative behaviour in a free-rider dilemma. Synchrony and arousal also interacted on measures of clustering and cooperation such that synchrony only encouraged closer clustering—and encouraged greater cooperation—when paired with physiological arousal. The research helps us understand why synchrony and arousal often co-occur in rituals around the world. It also represents the first use of real-time spatial tracking as a precise and naturalistic method of simulating collective rituals.},

Values emphasizing tolerance and self-expression have diverged most sharply, especially between high-income Western countries and the rest of the world. We also find that countries with similar per-capita {GDP} levels have held similar values over the last 40 years. Over time, however, geographic proximity has emerged as an increasingly strong correlate of value similarity, indicating that values have diverged globally but converged regionally.},

We show that color naming in Nafaanra has changed over the past four decades while remaining nearoptimally efﬁcient, and that this outcome would be unlikely under a random drift process that maintains structured color categories without pressure for efﬁciency. To our knowledge, this ﬁnding provides the ﬁrst direct evidence that color naming evolves under pressure for efﬁciency, supporting the hypothesis that efﬁciency shapes the evolution of the lexicon.},

            A central debate in cognitive science concerns the nativist hypothesis: the proposal that universal human behaviors are underpinned by strong, domain-specific, innate constraints on cognition. We use a general model of the processes that shape human behavior—learning, culture, and biological evolution—to test the evolutionary plausibility of this hypothesis. A series of analyses shows that culture radically alters the relationship between natural selection and cognition. Culture facilitates rapid biological adaptation yet rules out nativism: Behavioral universals arise that are underpinned by weak biases rather than strong innate constraints. We therefore expect culture to have dramatically shaped the evolution of the human mind, giving us innate predispositions that only weakly constrain our behavior.
          , 
            A central debate in cognitive science concerns the nativist hypothesis, the proposal that universal features of behavior reflect a biologically determined cognitive substrate: For example, linguistic nativism proposes a domain-specific faculty of language that strongly constrains which languages can be learned. An evolutionary stance appears to provide support for linguistic nativism, because coordinated constraints on variation may facilitate communication and therefore be adaptive. However, language, like many other human behaviors, is underpinned by social learning and cultural transmission alongside biological evolution. We set out two models of these interactions, which show how culture can facilitate rapid biological adaptation yet rule out strong nativization. The amplifying effects of culture can allow weak cognitive biases to have significant population-level consequences, radically increasing the evolvability of weak, defeasible inductive biases; however, the emergence of a strong cultural universal does not imply, nor lead to, nor require, strong innate constraints. From this we must conclude, on evolutionary grounds, that the strong nativist hypothesis for language is false. More generally, because such reciprocal interactions between cultural and biological evolution are not limited to language, nativist explanations for many behaviors should be reconsidered: Evolutionary reasoning shows how we can have cognitively driven behavioral universals and yet extreme plasticity at the level of the individual—if, and only if, we account for the human capacity to transmit knowledge culturally. Wherever culture is involved, weak cognitive biases rather than strong innate constraints should be the default assumption.},

	abstract = {Socioecological psychology investigates humans’ cognitive, emotional, and behavioral adaption to physical, interpersonal, economic, and political environments. This article summarizes three types of socioecological psychology research: (a) association studies that link an aspect of social ecology (e.g., population density) with psychology (e.g., prosocial behavior), (b) process studies that clarify why there is an association between social ecology and psychology (e.g., residential mobility → anxiety → familiarity seeking), and (c) niche construction studies that illuminate how psychological states give rise to the creation and maintenance of a social ecology (e.g., familiarity seeking → dominance of national chain stores). Socioecological psychology attempts to bring the objectivist perspective to psychological science, investigating how objective social and physical environments, not just perception and construal of the environments, affect one’s thinking, feeling, and behaviors, as well as how people’s thinking, feeling, and behaviors give rise to social and built environments.},

              et al
              . studied a large number of participants to explore the evolution of algorithms under different learning conditions (see the Perspective by Henrich). Selective social learning that involved knowledge of the success level of different strategies or of different models preserved difficult-to-invent, efficient algorithms more than random social learning or one-attempt asocial learning. Two efficient algorithms were used by many people, but the most efficient one only spread under selective social learning. —{PRS}

            Languages vary in their systems of kinship categories, but the scope of possible variation appears to be constrained. Previous accounts of kin classification have often emphasized constraints that are specific to the domain of kinship and are not derived from general principles. Here, we propose an account that is founded on two domain-general principles: Good systems of categories are simple, and they enable informative communication. We show computationally that kin classification systems in the world’s languages achieve a near-optimal trade-off between these two competing principles. We also show that our account explains several specific constraints on kin classification proposed previously. Because the principles of simplicity and informativeness are also relevant to other semantic domains, the trade-off between them may provide a domain-general foundation for variation in category systems across languages.},

Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resourcerational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind’s most impressive cognitive skills with people’s ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.},

In Religion Evolving, Purzycki and Sosis bridge both traditions and encourage a more integrated evolutionary science of religion. In this essay, I present three suggestions for how to make this science as ambitious and collaborative as possible. These suggestions are: (1) to move beyond straw man debates that pit byproduct models against functional models of religious evolution and acknowledge that these models are compatible from a dual inheritance perspective, (2) to evaluate functionalist claims with caution, recognizing how and when religion is adaptive vs. maladaptive for secular society, and (3) to avoid reductive definitions of religion and embrace religious pluralism. With these lessons in mind, we can usher in a bolder evolutionary science of religion that draws from both cognitive and cultural traditions.},

              Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler {JH}, Christakis {NA} (2008)
              {BMJ}
              337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

Analyses show significant variation in networks of emotion concept colexification, which is predicted by the geographic proximity of language families. We also find evidence of universal structure in emotion colexification networks, with all families differentiating emotions primarily on the basis of hedonic valence and physiological activation.

            Amid the present {COVID}-19 pandemic, we find that many citizens around the world “rally ‘round the flag” and increase their support for their respective political leaders. We observe these findings among countries that are culturally and geographically diverse, and even among leaders who are strongly disliked by citizens prior to the pandemic. Our findings could have important voting implications during or immediately after the pandemic. As an example, the Korean ruling party won the most seats in the house by any party since 1960 in an election held during the pandemic in April 2020. {COVID}-19 might thus serve as a catalyst to help some incumbent governments.

Using three unique datasets which comprise daily approval ratings of head of government (

In particular, we describe how two forms of language analysis—natural-language processing and comparative linguistics—are contributing to how we understand topics as diverse as emotion, creativity, and religion and overcoming obstacles related to statistical power and culturally diverse samples. We summarize resources for learning both of these methods and highlight the best way to combine language analysis with more traditional psychological paradigms.

We used deep neural networks to extract features from 35,326 facial images. These features were entered into a logistic regression aimed at classifying sexual orientation. Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81\% of cases, and in 71\% of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61\% for men and 54\% for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91\% and 83\%, respectively, given five facial images per person. Facial features employed by the classifier included both fixed (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial features (e.g., grooming style). Consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction models aimed at gender alone allowed for detecting gay males with 57\% accuracy and gay females with 58\% accuracy. Those findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual orientation and the limits of human perception. Additionally, given that companies and governments are increasingly using computer vision algorithms to detect people’s intimate traits, our findings expose a threat to the privacy and safety of gay men and women.},

This approach is optimal to isolate the importance of information flow from lower to higher cortical areas. The degree to which feedback connections and Bayesian hierarchical predictive coding contribute to how mammals process more complex social stimuli has been less explored, and will be the focus of this review. We illustrate paradigms that start to capture how participants predict the actions and emotions of others under more ecological conditions, and discuss the brain activity measurement methods suitable to reveal the importance of feedback connections in these predictions. Together, these efforts draw a richer picture of social cognition in which predictive coding and feedback connections play significant roles. We further discuss how the notion of predicting coding is influencing how we think of autism spectrum disorder.},

	abstract = {Building social bonds is a critical task of adolescence that affords opportunities for learning, identity formation, and social support. Failing to develop close relationships in adolescence hinders adult interpersonal functioning and contributes to problems such as loneliness and depression. During adolescence, increased reward sensitivity and greater social flexibility both contribute to healthy social development, yet we lack a clear theory of how these processes interact to support social functioning. Here, we propose synthesizing these two literatures using a computational reinforcement learning framework that recasts how adolescents pursue and learn from social rewards as a social explore-exploit problem. To become socially skilled, adolescents must balance both their efforts to form individual bonds within specific groups and manage memberships across multiple groups to maximize access to social resources. We draw on insights from sociological studies on social capital in collective networks and neurocognitive research on foraging and cooperation to describe the social explore-exploit dilemma faced by adolescents navigating a modern world with increasing access to diverse resources and group memberships. Our account provides important new directions for examining the dynamics of adolescent behavior in social groups and understanding how social value computations can support positive relationships into adulthood.},

	abstract = {People often choose between sticking with an available good option (exploitation) and trying out a new option that is uncertain but potentially more rewarding (exploration)1,2. Laboratory studies on explore–exploit decisions often contain real-world complexities such as non-stationary environments, stochasticity under exploitation and unknown reward distributions3–7. However, such factors might limit the researcher’s ability to understand the essence of people’s explore–exploit decisions. For this reason, we introduce a minimalistic task in which the optimal policy is to start off exploring and to switch to exploitation at most once in each sequence of decisions. The behaviour of 49 laboratory and 143 online participants deviated both qualitatively and quantitatively from the optimal policy, even when allowing for bias and decision noise. Instead, people seem to follow a suboptimal rule in which they switch from exploration to exploitation when the highest reward so far exceeds a certain threshold. Moreover, we show that this threshold decreases approximately linearly with the proportion of the sequence that remains, suggesting a temporal ratio law. Finally, we find evidence for ‘sequence-level’ variability that is shared across all decisions in the same sequence. Our results emphasize the importance of examining sequence-level strategies and their variability when studying sequential decision-making.},

In recent years there has been a surge of interest into how people make intertemporal decisions, given that such decisions are ubiquitous in everyday life and central in domains from substance use to climate change action. While it is clear that people make decisions according to rules, intuitions and habits, they also commonly deliberate over their options, thinking through potential outcomes and reflecting on their own preferences. In this Perspective, we bring to bear recent research into the higher-order capacities that underpin deliberation—particularly those that enable people to think about the future (prospection) and their own thinking (metacognition)—to shed light on intertemporal decision-making. We show how a greater appreciation for these mechanisms of deliberation promises to advance our understanding of intertemporal decision-making and unify a wide range of otherwise disparate choice phenomena.},

Second, as outlined in computational models, habits and deliberate goal pursuit guide actions synergistically, although habits are the efﬁcient, default mode of response. Third, people tend to infer from the frequency of habit performance that the behavior must have been intended.

	abstract = {Residents living in neighborhoods marked by concentrated disadvantage (i.e., poverty, joblessness, residential segregation) contend with resource scarcity. Theories indicate that competition for resources from an insufficient pool within the context of concentrated disadvantage may be one factor that promotes social norm violations. A limited body of experimental research has explored the impact of concentrated disadvantage on decision-making about obtaining resources, and in other research, the potential connection between concentrated disadvantage and engagement in social norm violation. Participants (N = 112) completed patch-foraging tasks in resource-rich and resource-depleted (i.e., scarce) environments. Participants then completed a social norm foraging task where they could trespass and forage on their neighbor’s land, which was resource-rich compared to their own. Computational modeling was used to evaluate explore-exploit decision-making in the resource-rich and resourcedepleted environments. The frequency of crossing and foraging was used to capture social norm violations. Results indicated that individuals who experience higher levels of concentrated disadvantage in the real-world made fewer resource-maximizing decisions in resource-rich and resource-depleted environments. Model fits revealed that the performance difference in the resource-rich and resource-depleted environments for individuals higher on concentrated disadvantage was due to difficulty in discriminating between competing choice options and not due to a general bias toward exploring or exploiting. Finally, when foraging in a relatively depleted environment compared to the enriched environment of their neighbor, the majority of participants, regardless of experienced real-world concentrated disadvantage, engaged in social norm violations. Overall, resource scarcity, whether in the real world or experimental context, affects cognition and behavior.},

With experience, participants learn to switch appropriately between exploration and exploitation and approach optimal performance. We model participants' behavior on this task with random, threshold, and sampling strategies, and find that a linear decreasing threshold rule best fits participants' results. Further evidence that participants use decreasing threshold-based strategies comes from reaction time differences between exploration and exploitation; however, participants themselves report non-decreasing thresholds. Decreasing threshold strategies that “front-load” exploration and switch quickly to exploitation are particularly effective in resource accumulation tasks, in contrast to optimal stopping problems like the Secretary Problem requiring longer exploration.},

	abstract = {The enormous scale of the available information and products on the Internet has necessitated the development of algorithms that intermediate between options and human users. These algorithms attempt to provide the user with relevant information. In doing so, the algorithms may incur potential negative consequences stemming from the need to select items about which it is uncertain to obtain information about users versus the need to select items about which it is certain to secure high ratings. This tension is an instance of the exploration–exploitation trade-off in the context of recommender systems. Because humans are in this interaction loop, the long-term trade-off behavior depends on human variability. Our goal is to characterize the trade-off behavior as a function of human variability fundamental to such human–algorithm interaction. To tackle the characterization, we first introduce a unifying model that smoothly transitions between active learning and recommending relevant information. The unifying model gives us access to a continuum of algorithms along the exploration–exploitation trade-off. We then present two experiments to measure the trade-off behavior under two very different levels of human variability. The experimental results inform a thorough simulation study in which we modeled and varied human variability systematically over a wide rage. The main result is that exploration–exploitation trade-off grows in severity as human variability increases, but there exists a regime of low variability where algorithms balanced in exploration and exploitation can largely overcome the trade-off.},

This trade-off, known in optimal foraging theory as the exploration–exploitation trade-off, is featured prominently in other disciplines such as animal foraging, learning, and organizational behavior. Many of the framework’s principles can be applied to humans’ choices about their social resources, which we call social exploration/exploitation. Using known principles in the domain of social exploration/exploitation can help social psychologists better understand how and why people choose their relationships, which ultimately affect their health and well-being. In this article, we discuss the costs and beneﬁts of social exploration and social exploitation. We then synthesize known person- and situation-level predictors of social decision making, reframing them in the language of the explore–exploit trade-off. We propose that people explore more when they ﬁnd it more rewarding and less costly, and when the environment has many opportunities to do so. We conclude by discussing hypotheses generated by applying optimal foraging theory to social decision making.},

              Given the ubiquity of exploration in everyday life, researchers from many disciplines have developed methods to measure exploratory behaviour. There are therefore many ways to quantify and measure exploration. However, it remains unclear whether the different measures (i) have convergent validity relative to one another, (ii) capture a domain general tendency, and (iii) capture a tendency that is stable across time. In a sample of 678 participants, we found very little evidence of convergent validity for the behavioural measures (Hypothesis 1); most of the behavioural measures lacked sufficient convergent validity with one another or with the self-reports. In psychometric modelling analyses, we could not identify a good fitting model with an assumed general tendency to explore (Hypothesis 2); the best fitting model suggested that the different behavioural measures capture behaviours that are specific to the tasks. In a subsample of 254 participants who completed the study a second time, we found that the measures had stability across an 1 month timespan (Hypothesis 3). Therefore, although there were stable individual differences in how people approached each task across time, there was no generalizability across tasks, and drawing broad conclusions about exploratory behaviour from studies using these tasks may be problematic.

	abstract = {Thoughts and actions are often driven by a decision to either explore new avenues with unknown outcomes, or to exploit known options with predictable outcomes. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying this explorationexploitation trade-off in humans remain poorly understood. This is attributable to variability in the operationalization of exploration and exploitation as psychological constructs, as well as the heterogeneity of experimental protocols and paradigms used to study these choice behaviours. To address this gap, here we present a comprehensive review of the literature to investigate the neural basis of explore-exploit decision-making in humans. We first conducted a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies of exploration-versus exploitation-based decision-making in healthy adult humans during foraging, reinforcement learning, and information search. Eleven {fMRI} studies met inclusion criterion for this review. Adopting a network neuroscience framework, synthesis of the findings across these studies revealed that exploration-based choice was associated with the engagement of attentional, control, and salience networks. In contrast, exploitationbased choice was associated with engagement of default network brain regions. We interpret these results in the context of a network architecture that supports the flexible switching between externally and internally directed cognitive processes, necessary for adaptive, goal-directed behaviour. To further investigate potential neural mechanisms underlying the exploration-exploitation trade-off we next surveyed studies involving neurodevelopmental, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as lifespan development, and neurodegenerative diseases. We observed striking differences in patterns of explore-exploit decision-making across these populations, again suggesting that these two decision-making modes are supported by independent neural circuits. Taken together, our review highlights the need for precision-mapping of the neural circuitry and behavioural correlates associated with exploration and exploitation in humans. Characterizing exploration versus exploitation decision-making biases may offer a novel, trans-diagnostic approach to assessment, surveillance, and intervention for cognitive decline and dysfunction in normal development and clinical populations.},

An ideal exploration–exploitation balance is crucial for maximizing reward over the long run. However, the neural signatures of exploration in humans remain unclear. Using quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on exploratory behaviors, we sought to identify the concordant activity pertaining to exploration over a range of experiments. The results revealed that exploration activates concordant brain activity associated with risk (e.g., dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula), cognitive control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus), and motor processing (e.g., premotor cortex). These stereotaxic maps of exploration may indicate that exploration is highly linked to risk processing, but is also specifically associated with regions involved in executive control processes. Although this explanation should be treated as exploratory, these findings support theories positing an important role for the prefrontal–insular–motor cortical network in exploration.},

Here, we combined placebo and explore-exploit paradigms to examine detection and selection of the most effective treatment in a pain model. During conditioning, where ‘optimal’ and ‘suboptimal’ sham-treatments were paired with a reduction in electrical pain stimulation, participants learnt which treatment most successfully reduced pain. Modelling participant responses revealed three important findings. First, participants’ choices reflected both directed and random exploration. Second, expectancy modulated pain – indicative of recursive placebo effects. Third, individual differences in terms of expectancy during conditioning predicted placebo effects during a subsequent test phase. These findings reveal directed and random exploration when the outcome is biologically-relevant. Moreover, this research shows how placebo and explore-exploit literatures can be unified.},

In this review, we examine whether the tuning of model parameters that govern different aspects of learning and decisionmaking processes vary consistently as a function of age, and what neurocognitive developmental changes may account for differences in these parameter estimates across development. We explore whether patterns of developmental change in these estimates are better described by differences in the extent to which individuals adapt their learning processes to the statistics of different environments, or by more static learning biases that emerge across varied contexts. We focus specifically on learning rates and inverse temperature parameter estimates, and find evidence that from childhood to adulthood, individuals become better at optimally weighting recent outcomes during learning across diverse contexts and less exploratory in their value-based decisionmaking. We provide recommendations for how these two possibilities — and potential alternative accounts —can be tested more directly to build a cohesive body of research that yields greater insight into the development of core learning processes.},

We test participants' behavior in scenarios in which they have to find the optimum of a function while at the same time avoid outputs below a certain threshold. In two experiments, we find that Safe-Optimization, a Gaussian Process-based exploration-exploitation algorithm, describes participants' behavior well and that participants seem to care firstly whether a point is safe and then try to pick the optimal point from all such safe points. This means that their trade-off between exploration and exploitation can be seen as an intelligent, approximate, and homeostasis-driven strategy.},

In this novel paradigm, participants repeatedly choose between multiple options in order to maximize their rewards.

From their experience with choosing options and observing the consequences of their decisions, participants can learn about the functional relation between contexts and rewards and improve their decision strategy over time. In three experiments, the authors explore participants’ behavior in such learning environments. They predict participants’ behavior by context-blind (mean-tracking, Kalman filter) and contextual (Gaussian process and linear regression) learning approaches combined with different choice strategies. Participants are mostly able to learn about the context-reward functions and their behavior is best described by a Gaussian process learning strategy which generalizes previous experience to similar instances. In a relatively simple task with binary features, they seem to combine this learning with a probability of improvement decision strategy which focuses on alternatives that are expected to lead to an improvement upon a current favorite option. In a task with continuous features that are linearly related to the rewards, participants seem to more explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, in a difficult learning environment where the relation between features and rewards is nonlinear, some participants are again well-described by a Gaussian process learning strategy, whereas others revert to context-blind strategies.},

            Social scientists have long debated why similar individuals often experience drastically different degrees of success. Some scholars have suggested such inequality merely reflects hard-to-observe personal differences in ability. Others have proposed that one fortunate success may trigger another, thus producing arbitrary differentiation. We conducted randomized experiments through intervention in live social systems to test for success-breeds-success dynamics. Results show that different kinds of success (money, quality ratings, awards, and endorsements) when bestowed upon arbitrarily selected recipients all produced significant improvements in subsequent rates of success as compared with the control group of nonrecipients. However, greater amounts of initial success failed to produce much greater subsequent success, suggesting limits to the distortionary effects of social feedback.
          , 
            Seemingly similar individuals often experience drastically different success trajectories, with some repeatedly failing and others consistently succeeding. One explanation is preexisting variability along unobserved fitness dimensions that is revealed gradually through differential achievement. Alternatively, positive feedback operating on arbitrary initial advantages may increasingly set apart winners from losers, producing runaway inequality. To identify social feedback in human reward systems, we conducted randomized experiments by intervening in live social environments across the domains of funding, status, endorsement, and reputation. In each system we consistently found that early success bestowed upon arbitrarily selected recipients produced significant improvements in subsequent rates of success compared with the control group of nonrecipients. However, success exhibited decreasing marginal returns, with larger initial advantages failing to produce much further differentiation. These findings suggest a lesser degree of vulnerability of reward systems to incidental or fabricated advantages and a more modest role for cumulative advantage in the explanation of social inequality than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Many everyday decisions require sequential search, according to which available choice options are observed one at a time, with each observation involving some cost to the decision maker. In these tasks, decision makers need to trade-off the chances of finding better options with the cost of search. Optimal strategies in such tasks involve threshold decision rules, which terminate the search as soon as an option exceeding a reward value is found. Threshold rules can be seen as special cases of well-known algorithmic decision processes, such as the satisficing heuristic. Prior work has found that decision makers do use threshold rules, however the stopping thresholds observed in data are typically smaller than the (expected value maximizing) optimal threshold. We put forward an array of cognitive models and use parametric model fits on participant-level search data to examine why decision makers adopt seemingly suboptimal thresholds. We find that people’s behavior is consistent with optimal search if we allow participants to display risk aversion, psychological effort cost, and decision error. Thus, decision makers appear to be able to search in a resource-rational manner that maximizes stochastic risk averse utility. Our findings shed light on the psychological factors that guide sequential decision making, and show how threshold models can be used to describe both computational and algorithmic aspects of search behavior.},

We further document a particularly pernicious learning trap driven by selective attention, a mechanism often assumed to facilitate learning in complex environments. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate the key attributes of the agent and environment that lead to this new type of learning trap. Then, in a series of experiments we present evidence that people robustly fall into this trap, even in the presence of various interventions predicted to meliorate it.

Such propensities are characteristically attributed to individual, organizational, and cultural traits such as risk aversion, uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of such phenomena. We show how the reproduction of successful actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased. These protections against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however. They increase the likelihood of persisting with alternatives that are poor in the long run as well as in the short run.},

            Competitions are part and parcel of daily life and require people to invest time and energy to gain advantage over others and to avoid (the risk of) falling behind. Whereas the behavioral mechanisms underlying competition are well documented, its neurocognitive underpinnings remain poorly understood. We addressed this using neuroimaging and computational modeling of individual investment decisions aimed at exploiting one's counterpart (“attack”) or at protecting against exploitation by one's counterpart (“defense”). Analyses revealed that during attack relative to defense (i) individuals invest less and are less successful; (ii) computations of expected reward are strategically more sophisticated (reasoning level k = 4 vs. k = 3 during defense); (iii) ventral striatum activity tracks reward prediction errors; (iv) risk prediction errors were not correlated with neural activity in either {ROI} or whole-brain analyses; and (v) successful exploitation correlated with neural activity in the bilateral ventral striatum, left {OFC}, left anterior insula, left {TPJ}, and lateral occipital cortex. We conclude that, in economic contests, coming out ahead (vs. not falling behind) involves sophisticated strategic reasoning that engages both reward and value computation areas and areas associated with theory of mind.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment’s specific conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once characterized as “playing twenty questions with nature,” theory is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the design space of possible experiments associated with a given research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just one. Researchers then iteratively generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the current paradigm – and with far greater efficiency.},

In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individual’s past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households.

Since the learner has a budget, the problem’s duration is ﬁnite. Consequently an optimal exploitation policy is not to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, but to pull the combination of arms that maximises the agent’s total reward within the budget. As such, the rewards for all arms must be estimated, because any of them may appear in the optimal combination. This di erence from existing {MABs} means that new approaches to maximising the total reward are required. To this end, we propose an –ﬁrst algorithm, in which the ﬁrst of the budget is used solely to learn the arms’ rewards (exploration), while the remaining 1 is used to maximise the received reward based on those estimates (exploitation). We derive bounds on the algorithm’s loss for generic and uniform exploration methods, and compare its performance with traditional {MAB} algorithms under various distributions of rewards and costs, showing that it outperforms the others by up to 50\%.},

	abstract = {Thompson sampling is one of the earliest randomized algorithms for multi-armed bandits ({MAB}). In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to Budgeted {MAB}, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is O(ln B), where B denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit ({MAB}) problem, {MAB} with cost subsidy, which models many real-life applications where the learning agent has to pay to select an arm and is concerned about optimizing cumulative costs and rewards. We present two applications, intelligent {SMS} routing problem and ad audience optimization problem faced by several businesses (especially online platforms), and show how our problem uniquely captures key features of these applications. We show that naive generalizations of existing {MAB} algorithms like Upper Conﬁdence Bound and Thompson Sampling do not perform well for this problem. We then establish a fundamental lower bound on the performance of any online learning algorithm for this problem, highlighting the hardness of our problem in comparison to the classical {MAB} problem. We also present a simple variant of explorethen-commit and establish near-optimal regret bounds for this algorithm. Lastly, we perform extensive numerical simulations to understand the behavior of a suite of algorithms for various instances and recommend a practical guide to employ diﬀerent algorithms.},

	abstract = {We study the stochastic Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit ({MAB}) problem, where a player chooses from K arms with unknown expected rewards and costs. The goal is to maximize the total reward under a budget constraint. A player thus seeks to choose the arm with the highest reward-cost ratio as often as possible. Current state-of-the-art policies for this problem have several issues, which we illustrate. To overcome them, we propose a new upper confidence bound ({UCB}) sampling policy, ω-{UCB}, that uses asymmetric confidence intervals. These intervals scale with the distance between the sample mean and the bounds of a random variable, yielding a more accurate and tight estimation of the reward-cost ratio compared to our competitors. We show that our approach has logarithmic regret and consistently outperforms existing policies in synthetic and real settings.},

The goal is to minimize the total expected regret after all rounds within a limited budget. Existing techniques in this literature either ﬁx the budget per round or ﬁx the number of arms pulled in each round. Our setting is more general where based on the remaining budget and remaining number of rounds, the algorithm can decide how many arms to be pulled in each round. First, we propose {CBwK}-Greedy-{UCB} algorithm, which uses a greedy technique, {CBwK}-Greedy, to allocate the arms to the rounds. Next, we propose a reduction of this problem to Bandits with Knapsacks ({BwK}) with a single pull. With this reduction, we propose {CBwK}-{LP}-{UCB} that uses {PrimalDualBwK} ingeniously. We rigorously prove regret bounds for {CBwK}-{LP}-{UCB}. We experimentally compare the two algorithms and observe that {CBwK}-{GreedyUCB} performs incrementally better than {CBwK}-{LP}-{UCB}. We also show that for very high budgets, the regret goes to zero.},

	abstract = {We study the multi-play budgeted multi-armed bandit ({MP}-{BMAB}) problem, in which pulling an arm receives both a random reward and a random cost, and a player pulls L( 1) arms at each round. The player targets at maximizing her total expected reward under a budget constraint B for the pulling costs. We present a multiple ratio conﬁdence bound policy: At each round, we ﬁrst calculate a truncated upper (lower) conﬁdence bound for the expected reward (cost) of each arm, and then pull the L arms with the maximum ratio of the sum of the upper conﬁdence bounds of rewards to the sum of the lower conﬁdence bounds of costs. We design a 01 integer linear fractional programming oracle that can pick such the L arms within polynomial time. We prove that the regret of our policy is sublinear in general and is log-linear for certain parameter settings. We further consider two special cases of {MP}-{BMABs}: (1) We derive a lower bound for any consistent policy for {MP}-{BMABs} with Bernoulli reward and cost distributions. (2) We show that the proposed policy can also solve conventional budgeted {MAB} problem (a special case of {MP}-{BMABs} with L = 1) and provides better theoretical results than existing {UCB}-based pulling policies.},

	abstract = {We consider a continuous time multi-arm bandit problem ({CTMAB}), where the learner can sample arms any number of times in a given interval and obtain a random reward from each sample, however, increasing the frequency of sampling incurs an additive penalty/cost. Thus, there is a tradeoff between obtaining large reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling frequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes the regret, that is deﬁned as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that of the learning algorithm. We establish lower bounds on the regret achievable with any algorithm, and propose algorithms that achieve the lower bound up to logarithmic factors. For the single arm case, we show that the lower bound on the regret is Ω(1/µ), and an upper bound with regret O((log(T /λ))2/µ), where µ is the mean of the arm, T is the time horizon, and λ is the tradeoff parameter between the payoff and the sampling cost. With K arms, we show that the lower bound on the regret is Ω(Kµ[1]/∆2), and an upper bound O(K(log(T /λ))2µ[1]/∆2) where µ[1] now represents the mean of the best arm, and ∆ is the difference of the mean of the best and the second-best arm.},

Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.},

            Existing research on the extensive Chinese censorship organization uses observational methods with well-known limitations. We conducted the first large-scale experimental study of censorship by creating accounts on numerous social media sites, randomly submitting different texts, and observing from a worldwide network of computers which texts were censored and which were not. We also supplemented interviews with confidential sources by creating our own social media site, contracting with Chinese firms to install the same censoring technologies as existing sites, and—with their software, documentation, and even customer support—reverse-engineering how it all works. Our results offer rigorous support for the recent hypothesis that criticisms of the state, its leaders, and their policies are published, whereas posts about real-world events with collective action potential are censored.},

In an effort to facilitate trust, many platforms encourage sellers to provide personal profiles and even to post pictures of themselves. However, these features may also facilitate discrimination based on sellers’ race, gender, age, or other aspects of appearance. In this paper, we test for racial discrimination against landlords in the online rental marketplace Airbnb.com. Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12\% more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust.},

In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

A positive illusory correlation emerges when evaluations are compensatory or disjunctive and a negative illusory correlation can emerge when evaluations are conjunctive. Our theory provides an alternative explanation for illusory correlations that does not rely on biased information processing nor selective attention to different pieces of information. It provides a new perspective on several well-established empirical phenomena such as the ‘Halo’ effect in personality perception, the relation between proximity and attitudes, and the in-group out-group bias in stereotype formation.},

Because negative experiences decrease the probability of interaction, negative initial impressions are more stable than positive impressions. Negative initial impressions, however, are more likely to change for individuals who are frequently exposed to others. As a result, systematic differences in interaction patterns, due to social similarity or proximity, will produce systematic differences in impressions.

Our results show that a bias against alternatives that improve with practice is due to an asymmetry in error correction rather than to myopic learning.

Most of these sample-based explanations assume that decision makers are “naive”: They are not aware of the biases in the available information sample and do not correct for them. Here, we show that this “naivety” assumption is not necessary. Systematically biased judgments can emerge even when decision makers process available information perfectly and are also aware of how the information sample has been generated. Specifically, we develop a rational analysis of Denrell’s (2005) experience sampling model, and we prove that when information search is interested rather than disinterested, even rational information sampling and processing can give rise to systematic patterns of errors in judgments. Our results illustrate that a tendency to favor alternatives for which outcome information is more accessible can be consistent with rational behavior. The model offers a rational explanation for behaviors that had previously been attributed to cognitive and motivational biases, such as the in-group bias or the tendency to prefer popular alternatives.},

We show that a bias against alternatives that improve with practice does not require that learning is myopic in the sense of lacking foresight or failing to explore. The same bias occurs even if learners engage in substantial exploration and have foresight. In fact, we demonstrate that even a rational and foresighted learner, who follow an optimal strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation, will learn to prefer alternatives with initially high payoffs that decrease with practice over alternatives, with identical expected values, that have initially low payoffs that increase with practice. Our results show that a bias against alternatives that improve with practice is due to an asymmetry in error correction rather than to myopic learning. The implication is that a wide range of selection systems, even optimally designed ones, will be biased against late-bloomers.},

Achieving this balance is further complicated in reactive environments where actions produce long-lasting change to the system. In four experiments, we investigate how people learn to make effective decisions from experience in a dynamic multiarmed bandit task. In contrast to the typical exploitation-dependent diminishing rewards found in previous studies, options were framed as skills that developed greater rewards the more they were chosen. In Experiment 1, we provide a proof of concept, and in Experiments 2– 4 we explore the boundaries of participants’ sensitivity to reactive dynamics. Our results suggest that most individuals can learn effective strategies for coping with these reactive environments. A two-part comparison of several competing psychological models supports several conclusions: (a) a sizable minority of individuals learned that their environment was reactive, (b) evidence suggests several distinct groups of individuals employed unique decision strategies, and (c) testing models with the simulation method reveals qualitative misfits that motivate future theory development.},

	abstract = {Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, reflecting the extent to which groups are considered competent and trustworthy. Traditional explanations for stereotypes 5 – group motives, cognitive biases, minority/majority environments, or real-group differences –assume that they result from deficits in humans or their environments. A recently-proposed alternative explanation – that stereotypes can emerge when exploration is costly – posits that even optimal decision-makers in an ideal environment can inadvertently create incorrect impressions. However, existing theories fail to explain the multidimensionality of stereotypes. 10 We show that multidimensional stratification and the associated stereotypes can result from feature-based exploration: when individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost, and when these options share similar attributes, they are more likely to separate groups along multiple dimensions. We formalize this theory via the contextual multi-armed bandit problem, use the 15 resulting model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. In particular, we evaluate this process in incentivized decisions involving as many as 20 real jobs, and successfully recover the classic warmth-by-competence stereotype space. Further experiments show that intervening on the cost of exploration effectively mitigates bias, further demonstrating that exploration cost per se is the operating variable. Future diversity 20 interventions may consider how to reduce exploration cost, such as introducing bonus rewards for diverse hires, assessing candidates using challenging tasks, and randomly making some groups unavailable for selection.},

Historical accidents can snowball into globally inaccurate generalizations, and inaccurate stereotypes can emerge in the absence of real group differences. Using multiarmed-bandit models, we found that the mere act of choosing among groups with the goal of maximizing the long-term benefit of interactions is enough to produce inaccurate assessments of different groups. This phenomenon was reproduced in two large online experiments with English-speaking adults (N = 2,404), which demonstrated a minimal process that suffices to produce biased impressions.},

Our experimental work is motivated by rational analysis of the problem that makes strong predictions about information search and reward seeking in static and changeable environments. Our results show a striking agreement between human behavior and the optimal policy, but also highlight a number of systematic differences.

	abstract = {In non-stationary environments, there is a conﬂict between exploiting currently favored options and gaining information by exploring lesser-known options that in the past have proven less rewarding. Optimal decision-making in such tasks requires considering future states of the environment (i.e., planning) and properly updating beliefs about the state of the environment after observing outcomes associated with choices. Optimal beliefupdating is reﬂective in that beliefs can change without directly observing environmental change. For example, after 10 s elapse, one might correctly believe that a trafﬁc light last observed to be red is now more likely to be green. To understand human decision-making when rewards associated with choice options change over time, we develop a variant of the classic “bandit” task that is both rich enough to encompass relevant phenomena and sufﬁciently tractable to allow for ideal actor analysis of sequential choice behavior. We evaluate whether people update beliefs about the state of environment in a reﬂexive (i.e., only in response to observed changes in reward structure) or reﬂective manner. In contrast to purely “random” accounts of exploratory behavior, model-based analyses of the subjects’ choices and latencies indicate that people are reﬂective belief updaters. However, unlike the Ideal Actor model, our analyses indicate that people’s choice behavior does not reﬂect consideration of future environmental states. Thus, although people update beliefs in a reﬂective manner consistent with the Ideal Actor, they do not engage in optimal long-term planning, but instead myopically choose the option on every trial that is believed to have the highest immediate payoff.},

This model functionally decomposes this cost-benefit analysis and has been used to fill gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of mental effort and to generate novel predictions about the sources of variability in real-world performance.

            The amount of mental effort we invest in a task is influenced by the reward we can expect if we perform that task well. However, some of the rewards that have the greatest potential for driving these efforts are partly determined by factors beyond one’s control. In such cases, effort has more limited efficacy for obtaining rewards. According to the Expected Value of Control theory, people integrate information about the expected reward and efficacy of task performance to determine the expected value of control, and then adjust their control allocation (i.e., mental effort) accordingly. Here we test this theory’s key behavioral and neural predictions. We show that participants invest more cognitive control when this control is more rewarding and more efficacious, and that these incentive components separately modulate {EEG} signatures of incentive evaluation and proactive control allocation. Our findings support the prediction that people combine expectations of reward and efficacy to determine how much effort to invest.},

            Experiencing events as controllable is essential for human well-being. Based on classic psychological theory, we test how internal control beliefs impact the affective valuation of task outcomes, neural dynamics and ensuing behavioral preferences. In three consecutive studies we show that dynamics in positive affect increase, with a qualitative shift towards self-evaluative pride, when agents believe they caused a given outcome. We demonstrate that these outcomes engage brain networks processing self-referential information in the cortical midline. Here, activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks outcome valence regarding both success as well as internal control, and covaries with positive affect in response to outcomes. These affective dynamics also relate to increased functional coupling between the ventral striatum and cortical midline structures. Finally, we show that pride predicts preferences for control, even at monetary costs. Our investigations extend recent models of positive affect and well-being, and emphasize that control beliefs drive intrinsic motivation.},

It has long been known that perceived control is a major contributor toward mental and physical health as well as a strong predictor of achievements in life. However, one issue that limits a mechanistic understanding of perceived control is the heterogeneity of how the term is deﬁned in models in psychology and neuroscience, and used in experimental settings across a wide spectrum of studies. Here, we propose a framework for studying perceived control by integrating the ideas from traditionally separate work on perceived control. Speciﬁcally, we discuss key properties of perceived control from a reward-based framework, including choice opportunity, instrumental contingency, and success/reward rate. We argue that these separate reward-related processes are integral to fostering an enhanced perception of control and inﬂuencing an individual’s behavior and well-being. We draw on select studies to elucidate how these reward-related elements are implicated separately and collectively in the investigation of perceived control. We highlight the role of dopamine within corticostriatal pathways shared by reward-related processes and perceived control. Finally, through the lens of this reward-based framework of perceived control, we consider the implications of perceived control in clinical deﬁcits and how these insights could help us better understand psychopathology and treatment options.},

            A Pavlovian bias to approach reward-predictive cues and avoid punishment-predictive cues can conflict with instrumentally-optimal actions. Here, we propose that the brain arbitrates between Pavlovian and instrumental control by inferring which is a better predictor of reward. The instrumental predictor is more flexible; it can learn values that depend on both stimuli and actions, whereas the Pavlovian predictor learns values that depend only on stimuli. The arbitration theory predicts that the Pavlovian predictor will be favored when rewards are relatively uncontrollable, because the additional flexibility of the instrumental predictor is not useful. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the Pavlovian approach bias is stronger under low control compared to high control contexts.},

In this review, we will synthesize empirical findings and neurocomputational frameworks related to social controllability. We first introduce the concepts of contextual and perceived controllability and their respective relevance for decision-making. Then, we outline neurocomputational frameworks that can be used to model social controllability, with a focus on behavioral economic paradigms and reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of social controllability for computational psychiatry research, using delusion and obsession-compulsion as examples.

While statistical analyses can help establish causal relationships, it can also provide strong evidence of causality where none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of causal inference. Instead of focusing on specific statistical methods, such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give statistical estimates a causal interpretation. Such assumptions are often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions are critical to any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the design-based approach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.},

	abstract = {Significance
            This study sheds light on how 9/11 catalyzed long-term changes in the political behaviors of victims’ families and neighbors. Political changes among associates of victims are important because system shocks like 9/11 can lead to rapid policy shifts, and relatives of victims often become leaders advocating for such shifts. I build upon prior research on the behavioral effects of tragic events by using a unique method of analysis. Rather than utilizing surveys, I link together individual-level government databases from before and after 9/11, and I measure the changes in the affected populations relative to similar populations that did not lose a relative or neighbor. The method I outline may prove useful in future studies of human behavior.
          , 
            This article investigates the long-term effect of September 11, 2001 on the political behaviors of victims’ families and neighbors. Relative to comparable individuals, family members and residential neighbors of victims have become—and have stayed—significantly more active in politics in the last 12 years, and they have become more Republican on account of the terrorist attacks. The method used to demonstrate these findings leverages the random nature of the terrorist attack to estimate a causal effect and exploits new techniques to link multiple, individual-level, governmental databases to measure behavioral change without relying on surveys or aggregate analysis.},

            We investigate the degree to which impact in science and technology is associated with surprising breakthroughs, and how those breakthroughs arise. Identifying breakthroughs across science and technology requires models that distinguish surprising from expected advances at scale. Drawing on tens of millions of research papers and patents across the life sciences, physical sciences and patented inventions, and using a hypergraph model that predicts realized combinations of research contents (article keywords) and contexts (cited journals), here we show that surprise in terms of unexpected combinations of contents and contexts predicts outsized impact (within the top 10\% of citations). These surprising advances emerge across, rather than within researchers or teams—most commonly when scientists from one field publish problem-solving results to an audience from a distant field. Our approach characterizes the frontier of science and technology as a complex hypergraph drawn from high-dimensional embeddings of research contents and contexts, and offers a measure of path-breaking surprise in science and technology.},

Here, we instead consider how stereotypes arise from basic processes of approach and avoidance in social learning. Across ﬁve studies, we show that initial negative interactions with some members of a group can cause subsequent avoidance of the entire group, and that this avoidance perpetuates stereotypes in two ways. First, when information gain is contingent on approaching the target, avoidance restricts the information available with which to update one’s beliefs. Second, computational models that consider the perceiver’s full reinforcement history demonstrate that avoidance directly reinforces itself, such that initial avoidance of group members increases the probability of later acts of avoidance toward that group. Finally, we ﬁnd initial evidence for a potential dissociation between behavior and explicit beliefs, with avoidance reinforcing avoidant behaviors without necessarily affecting self-reported beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that avoidance behaviors toward members of social groups can perpetuate inaccurate negative beliefs and expectations about those groups, such that initial interactions with a group have a compounding effect on overall impressions.},

Here we examine the nature of goal tradeoffs in intergroup decision-making using a novel task in which participants simultaneously make monetary decisions for themselves, an arbitrary ingroup, and the corresponding outgroup. Across four behavioural studies and one eye-tracking study (total N = 704), we find that goals in intergroup contexts are pursued sequentially rather than concurrently, with non-linear upweighting of group-related goals when self-related goals cannot be pursued. Further, we find evidence for stronger self-ingroup than self-outgroup tradeoffs, which manifest in both altered attention to information and altered use of the attended information in decision-making. The results shed light on the cognitive structuring of interrelated goals in intergroup decisionmaking, furthering our understanding of when and how both intergroup biases and prosocial behaviour may emerge.},

Exploration is critical to obtain information to discover how the world works, which should be particularly important for young children. While studies have shown that young children explore in response to surprising events, little is known about how they balance exploration and exploitation across multiple decisions or about how this process changes with development. In this study, we compare decision-making patterns of children and adults and evaluate the relative influences of reward seeking, random exploration, and systematic switching (which approximates uncertainty-directed exploration). In a second experiment, we directly test the effect of uncertainty on children's choices. Influential models of decision-making generally describe systematic exploration as a computationally refined capacity that relies on top-down cognitive control. We demonstrate that (a) systematic patterns dominate young children's behavior (facilitating exploration), despite protracted development of cognitive control; and (b) that uncertainty plays a major, but complicated, role in determining children's choices. We conclude that while young children's immature top-down control should hinder adult-like systematic exploration, other mechanisms may pick up the slack, facilitating broad information gathering in a systematic fashion to build a foundation of knowledge for use later in life.},

	abstract = {Learning and generalization in spatial domains is often thought to rely on a “cognitive map”, representing relationships between spatial locations. Recent research suggests that this same neural machinery is also recruited for reasoning about more abstract, conceptual forms of knowledge. Yet, to what extent do spatial and conceptual reasoning share common computational principles, and what are the implications for behavior? Using a within-subject design we studied how participants used spatial or conceptual distances to generalize and search for correlated rewards in successive multi-armed bandit tasks. Participant behavior indicated sensitivity to both spatial and conceptual distance, and was best captured using a Bayesian model of generalization that formalized distance-dependent generalization and uncertainty-guided exploration as a Gaussian Process regression with a radial basis function kernel. The same Gaussian Process model best captured human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and could simulate realistic learning curves, where we found equivalent levels of generalization in spatial and conceptual tasks. At the same time, we also find characteristic differences between domains. Relative to the spatial domain, participants showed reduced levels of uncertainty-directed exploration and increased levels of random exploration in the conceptual domain. Participants also displayed a one-directional transfer effect, where experience in the spatial task boosted performance in the conceptual task, but not vice versa. While confidence judgments indicated that participants were sensitive to the uncertainty of their knowledge in both tasks, they did not or could not leverage their estimates of uncertainty to guide exploration in the conceptual task. These results support the notion that value-guided learning and generalization recruit cognitive-map dependent computational mechanisms in spatial and conceptual domains. Yet both behavioral and model-based analyses suggest domain specific differences in how these representations map onto actions.},

Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses ({SCRs}) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory {SCRs}, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does.

By using more sensitive methods, we show that participants have much more knowledge about the game than previously thought. In fact, participants report knowledge of the advantageous strategy more reliably than they behave advantageously. Furthermore, when they behave advantageously, their verbal reports nearly always reveal evidence of quantitative knowledge about the outcomes of the decks that would be sufficient to guide such advantageous behavior. In addition, there is evidence that participants also have access to more qualitative reportable knowledge. These results are compatible with the view that, in this task, both overt behavior and verbal reports reflect sampling from consciously accessible knowledge; there is no need to appeal to nonconscious somatic markers. We also discuss the findings of other studies that similarly suggest alternative interpretations of other evidence previously used to support a role for somatic markers in decision-making.},

Standard multiarmed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option’s spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.},

            Beliefs about the controllability of positive or negative events in the environment can shape learning throughout the lifespan. Previous research has shown that adults’ learning is modulated by beliefs about the causal structure of the environment such that they update their value estimates to a lesser extent when the outcomes can be attributed to hidden causes. This study examined whether external causes similarly influenced outcome attributions and learning across development. Ninety participants, ages 7 to 25 years, completed a reinforcement learning task in which they chose between two options with fixed reward probabilities. Choices were made in three distinct environments in which different hidden agents occasionally intervened to generate positive, negative, or random outcomes. Participants’ beliefs about hidden-agent intervention aligned with the true probabilities of the positive, negative, or random outcome manipulation in each of the three environments. Computational modeling of the learning data revealed that while the choices made by both adults (ages 18–25) and adolescents (ages 13–17) were best fit by Bayesian reinforcement learning models that incorporate beliefs about hidden-agent intervention, those of children (ages 7–12) were best fit by a one learning rate model that updates value estimates based on choice outcomes alone. Together, these results suggest that while children demonstrate explicit awareness of the causal structure of the task environment, they do not implicitly use beliefs about the causal structure of the environment to guide reinforcement learning in the same manner as adolescents and adults.},

Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model.

Such strategic decisions should incorporate not only recent reward history, but also opportunity costs and environmental statistics. Previous neuroimaging [5–8] and neurophysiological [9–13] studies have implicated orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum in distinguishing between bouts of exploration and exploitation. Nonetheless, the neuronal mechanisms that underlie strategy selection remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that posterior cingulate cortex ({CGp}), an area linking reward processing, attention [14], memory [15, 16], and motor control systems [17], mediates the integration of variables such as reward [18], uncertainty [19], and target location [20] that underlie this dynamic balance. Here we show that {CGp} neurons distinguish between exploratory and exploitative decisions made by monkeys in a dynamic foraging task. Moreover, ﬁring rates of these neurons predict in graded fashion the strategy most likely to be selected on upcoming trials. This encoding is distinct from switching between targets and is independent of the absolute magnitudes of rewards. These observations implicate {CGp} in the integration of individual outcomes across decision making and the modiﬁcation of strategy in dynamic environments.},

            The adaptive regulation of the balance between exploitation and exploration is critical for the optimization of behavioral performance. Animal research and computational modeling have suggested that changes in exploitative versus exploratory control state in response to changes in task utility are mediated by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus–norepinephrine ({LC}–{NE}) system. Recent studies have suggested that utility-driven changes in control state correlate with pupil diameter, and that pupil diameter can be used as an indirect marker of {LC} activity. We measured participants' pupil diameter while they performed a gambling task with a gradually changing payoff structure. Each choice in this task can be classified as exploitative or exploratory using a computational model of reinforcement learning. We examined the relationship between pupil diameter, task utility, and choice strategy (exploitation vs. exploration), and found that (i) exploratory choices were preceded by a larger baseline pupil diameter than exploitative choices; (ii) individual differences in baseline pupil diameter were predictive of an individual's tendency to explore; and (iii) changes in pupil diameter surrounding the transition between exploitative and exploratory choices correlated with changes in task utility. These findings provide novel evidence that pupil diameter correlates closely with control state, and are consistent with a role for the {LC}–{NE} system in the regulation of the exploration–exploitation trade-off in humans.},

We have modeled these tasks using Markov decision processes ({MDPs}). {MDPs} provide a general framework for modeling tasks in which decisions affect the information on which future choices will be made. Under the assumption that agents are maximizing expected rewards, {MDPs} provide normative solutions. We find that all three classes of tasks pose choices among actions which trade-off immediate and future expected rewards. The tasks drive these trade-offs in unique ways, however. For bandit and information sampling tasks, increasing uncertainty or the time horizon shifts value to actions that pay-off in the future. Correspondingly, decreasing uncertainty increases the relative value of actions that pay-off immediately. For foraging tasks the time-horizon plays the dominant role, as choices do not affect future uncertainty in these tasks.},

This level of specificity can in turn be beneficial to establish the identity of the corresponding behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms. In this paper, we will illustrate applications of computational methods using examples of lifespan research on risk taking, strategy selection and reinforcement learning.

Failing to develop close relationships in adolescence hinders adult interpersonal functioning and contributes to problems such as loneliness and depression. During adolescence, increased reward sensitivity and greater social flexibility both contribute to healthy social development, yet we lack a clear theory of how these processes interact to support social functioning. Here, we propose synthesizing these two literatures using a computational reinforcement learning framework that recasts how adolescents pursue and learn from social rewards as a social explore-exploit problem. To become socially skilled, adolescents must balance both their efforts to form individual bonds within specific groups and manage memberships across multiple groups to maximize access to social resources. We draw on insights from sociological studies on social capital in collective networks and neurocognitive research on foraging and cooperation to describe the social explore-exploit dilemma faced by adolescents navigating a modern world with increasing access to diverse resources and group memberships. Our account provides important new directions for examining the dynamics of adolescent behavior in social groups and understanding how social value computations can support positive relationships into adulthood.},

Decisionmaking with the benefit of the accumulated knowledge of a community can result in superior decisions compared to what people can achieve alone. However, groups of people face two coupled challenges in accumulating knowledge to make good decisions: (1) aggregating information and (2) addressing an informational public goods problem known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Here, we show how a Bayesian social sampling model can in principle simultaneously optimally aggregate information and nearly optimally solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The key idea we explore is that Bayesian rationality at the level of a population can be implemented through a more simplistic heuristic social learning mechanism at the individual level. This simple individual-level behavioral rule in the context of a group of decision-makers functions as a distributed algorithm that tracks a Bayesian posterior in population-level statistics.

              Human development is often described as a ‘cooling off’ process, analogous to stochastic optimization algorithms that implement a gradual reduction in randomness over time. Yet there is ambiguity in how to interpret this analogy, due to a lack of concrete empirical comparisons. Using data from
              n
               = 281 participants ages 5 to 55, we show that cooling off does not only apply to the single dimension of randomness. Rather, human development resembles an optimization process of multiple learning parameters, for example, reward generalization, uncertainty-directed exploration and random temperature. Rapid changes in parameters occur during childhood, but these changes plateau and converge to efficient values in adulthood. We show that while the developmental trajectory of human parameters is strikingly similar to several stochastic optimization algorithms, there are important differences in convergence. None of the optimization algorithms tested were able to discover reliably better regions of the strategy space than adult participants on this task.},

We study how children between the ages of 4 and 9 search in an explore–exploit task with spatially correlated rewards, where exhaustive exploration is infeasible and not all options can be experienced. By combining behavioral data with a computational model that decomposes search into similarity-based generalization, uncertainty-directed exploration, and random exploration, we map out developmental trajectories of generalization and exploration. The behavioral data show strong developmental differences in children's capability to exploit environmental structure, with performance and adaptiveness of sampling decisions increasing with age. Through model-based analyses, we disentangle different forms of exploration, finding signature of both uncertainty-directed and random exploration. The amount of random exploration strongly decreases as children get older, supporting the notion of a developmental “cooling off” process that modulates the randomness in sampling. However, even at the youngest age range, children do not solely rely on random exploration. Even as random exploration begins to taper off, children are actively seeking out options with high uncertainty in a goal-directed fashion, and using inductive inferences to generalize their experience to novel options. Our findings provide critical insights into the behavioral and computational principles underlying the developmental trajectory of learning and exploration.},

These properties deﬁne a number of basic functional trade-oﬀs that can be used to map the abstract “design space” of natural and artiﬁcial cognitive systems. Basic functional trade-oﬀs provide a shared vocabulary to describe a variety of speciﬁc trade-oﬀs including speed vs. accuracy, generalist vs. specialist, exploration vs. exploitation, and many others. By linking speciﬁc features of cognitive functioning to general properties such as robustness and eﬃciency, it becomes possible to harness some powerful insights from systems engineering and systems biology to suggest useful generalizations, point to under-explored but potentially important trade-oﬀs, and prompt novel hypotheses and connections between disparate areas of research.},

              Successful behavior in an uncertain, changing, and open-ended environment critically relies on the ability to decide between continuing with the ongoing strategy or exploring new options. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the human medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) is the part of the brain that primarily deals with this dilemma. However, the contribution of the different {mPFC} regions remains largely unknown. Domenech

The ventral {mPFC} inferred the reliability of the ongoing action plan according to action outcomes. It proactively flagged outcomes either as learning signals to better exploit this plan or as potential triggers to explore new ones. The dorsal {mPFC} then evaluated action outcomes and generated an adaptive behavioral strategy.

              {INTRODUCTION}
              Everyday life often requires arbitrating between pursuing an ongoing action plan by possibly adjusting it versus exploring new action plans instead. Resolving this so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma is critical to gradually build a repertoire of action plans for efficient adaptive behavior in uncertain, changing, and open-ended everyday environments. Previous studies have shown that its resolution primarily involves the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}). Human functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that activations in the ventromedial {PFC} ({vmPFC}) reflect the subjective value of the ongoing plan according to action outcomes, whereas the dorsomedial {PFC} ({dmPFC}) exhibits activations when this value drops and the plan is abandoned for exploring new ones. However, the neural mechanisms that resolve the dilemma and make the decision to exploit versus explore remain largely unknown.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              We addressed this issue by recording neuronal activity in participants using intracranial electroencephalography while they were performing a task that induced systematic exploitation-exploration dilemmas in an uncertain, changing, and open-ended environment. Participants were six epileptic patients with electrodes implanted in the {vmPFC} and {dmPFC} (see the figure), who were eventually diagnosed with temporal or parietal lobe epilepsy with no impacts in the {PFC}. Using computational modeling, we identified from participants’ behavior the so-called stay trials, when participants adjusted and exploited their ongoing action plan through reinforcement learning, and the switch trials, when action outcomes instead led participants to covertly switch away from this plan and explore new ones in the following trials. We then analyzed {vmPFC} and {dmPFC} neural activity in both stay and switch trials.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              {vmPFC} neural activity in the high-gamma frequency band ({\textgreater}50 Hz) that reflects local processing was found to encode outcome expectations after action selection. This {vmPFC} high-gamma activity further encoded the prior and posterior reliability of the ongoing action plan relative to action outcomes, which, according to the computational model, subserved the arbitration between exploiting and exploring. Notably, this reliability encoding yielded {vmPFC} activity to proactively flag forthcoming action outcomes as potential triggers to explore rather than as learning signals to exploit. Preceding the occurrence of action outcomes, switch trials—unlike stay trials—witnessed an increased neural activity in the beta frequency band (13 to 30 Hz) that reflects top-down neural processing (see the figure). Following action outcomes in switch compared with stay trials, {dmPFC} neural activity then decreased in the theta frequency band (4 to 8 Hz), which indicates that the {dmPFC} was then configured to respond to action outcomes according to this {vmPFC} proactive construct. In stay trials, outcome expectations encoded in the {vmPFC} were transmitted to the {dmPFC}, so that from 300 ms after action outcomes, {dmPFC} neural activity in the high-gamma frequency band encoded the reward prediction error (i.e., the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes that scales reinforcement learning). In switch trials, by contrast, this encoding was disrupted through reconfiguring {dmPFC} activity in the alpha frequency band (8 to 12 Hz) to release the inhibition bearing upon alternative action plans from 250 ms after action outcomes.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              The medial {PFC} resolves exploitation-exploration dilemmas through a predictive coding mechanism that was originally proposed for perception. The {vmPFC} monitors the reliability of the ongoing action plan to proactively set the functional signification of forthcoming action outcomes as either learning signals to exploit or potential triggers to explore. The {dmPFC} responds to action outcomes according to this functional construct, yielding to either stay and adjust the ongoing plan through reinforcement learning or switch away from this plan to explore new ones. This predictive coding mechanism has the advantage of speeding up the abandonment of ongoing action plans and preventing action outcomes that trigger exploration from inappropriately acting as learning signals. These findings support the idea that predictive coding also operates within the prefrontal executive system and constitutes a general mechanism that underlies information processing across the cerebral cortex. In perceptual neural systems, predictive coding operates so that observers’ prior beliefs about a scene alter how they perceive the scene. Our findings suggest that within the prefrontal executive system, predictive coding operates by proactively altering the functional signification of behavioral events according to the agents’ beliefs about their own behavior.

                  Neural activity around outcome onsets in switch compared with stay trials recorded in ventromedial (orange, {vmPFC}) and dorsomedial (blue, {dmPFC}) prefrontal electrodes implanted in the six patients. Electrode localizations are shown on a canonical sagittal brain slice [Montreal Neurological Institute ({MNI}) coordinate: x = −10], and neural activity is shown against time according to its spectral decomposition. {vmPFC} activity reflecting top-down neural processing increased and proactively flagged action outcomes as potential triggers to explore rather than as learning signals to exploit. {dmPFC} activity followed action outcomes triggering exploration through reconfiguring neural processing.

Resolving this so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma involves the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}). Using human intracranial electrophysiological recordings, we discovered that neural activity in the ventral {mPFC} infers and tracks the reliability of the ongoing plan to proactively encode upcoming action outcomes as either learning signals or potential triggers to explore new plans. By contrast, the dorsal {mPFC} exhibits neural responses to action outcomes, which results in either improving or abandoning the ongoing plan. Thus, the {mPFC} resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma through a two-stage, predictive coding process: a proactive ventromedial stage that constructs the functional signification of upcoming action outcomes and a reactive dorsomedial stage that guides behavior in response to action outcomes.},

While all contrasts yielded anterior cingulate and bilateral insulae, speciﬁcally prediction errors yielded more concordant activity within the striatum and amygdala, reversal errors yielded more concordant bilateral frontalparietal activity, and more concordant inferior frontal cortical occurred from reversal switching.

We test whether exploration and learning change across development using a task that presents a “learning trap.” In this task, exploitation—maximizing immediate reward and avoiding costs—may lead the learner to draw incorrect conclusions, while exploration may lead to better learning but be more costly. In Studies 1, 2, and 3 we find that preschoolers and early school-aged children explore more than adults and learn the true structure of the environment better. Study 3 demonstrates that children explore more than adults even though they, like adults, predict that exploration will be costly, and it shows that exploration and learning are correlated. Study 4 shows that children’s and adults’ learning depends on the evidence they generate during exploration: children exposed to adult-like evidence learn like adults, and adults exposed to child-like evidence learn like children. Together, these studies support the idea that children may be more exploratory than adults, and this increased exploration influences learning.},

I relate this developmental pattern to computational ideas about explore–exploit trade-offs, search and sampling, and to neuroscience findings.

The idea that dopamine modulates novelty seeking is supported by evidence that novel stimuli excite dopamine neurons and activate brain regions receiving dopaminergic input. In addition, dopamine is shown to drive exploratory behavior in novel environments. It is not clear whether dopamine promotes novelty seeking when it is framed as the decision to explore novel options versus the exploitation of familiar options. To test this hypothesis, we administered systemic injections of saline or {GBR}-12909, a selective dopamine transporter ({DAT}) inhibitor, to monkeys and assessed their novelty seeking behavior during a probabilistic decision making task. The task involved pseudorandom introductions of novel choice options. This allowed monkeys the opportunity to explore novel options or to exploit familiar options that they had already sampled. We found that {DAT} blockade increased the monkeys’ preference for novel options. A reinforcement learning ({RL}) model fit to the monkeys’ choice data showed that increased novelty seeking after {DAT} blockade was driven by an increase in the initial value the monkeys assigned to novel options. However, blocking {DAT} did not modulate the rate at which the monkeys learned which cues were most predictive of reward or their tendency to exploit that knowledge. These data demonstrate that dopamine enhances novelty-driven value and imply that excessive novelty seeking— characteristic of impulsivity and behavioral addictions—might be caused by increases in dopamine, stemming from less reuptake.},

An important component of {RL} is managing explore–exploit tradeoffs, which refers to the problem of choosing between exploiting options with known values and exploring unfamiliar options. We examined correlates of this tradeoff, as well as other {RL} related variables, in orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) while three male monkeys performed a three-armed bandit learning task. During the task, novel choice options periodically replaced familiar options. The values of the novel options were unknown, and the monkeys had to explore them to see if they were better than other currently available options. The identity of the chosen stimulus and the reward outcome were strongly encoded in the responses of single {OFC} neurons. These two variables define the states and state transitions in our model that are relevant to decision-making. The chosen value of the option and the relative value of exploring that option were encoded at intermediate levels. We also found that {OFC} value coding was stimulus specific, as opposed to coding value independent of the identity of the option. The location of the option and the value of the current environment were encoded at low levels. Therefore, we found encoding of the variables relevant to learning and managing explore–exploit tradeoffs in {OFC}.

Reward probability varies as a function of response time, whereas reward magnitude changes in the opposite direction. In the control condition, these factors exactly cancel, such that the expected value across time is constant ({CEV}). In two other conditions, expected value increases ({IEV}) or decreases ({DEV}), such that reward maximization requires either speeding up (Go learning) or slowing down ({NoGo} learning) relative to the {CEV} condition. We tested patients with Parkinson's disease (depleted striatal {DA} levels) on and off dopaminergic medication, compared with age-matched controls. While medicated, patients were better at speeding up in the {DEV} relative to {CEV} conditions. Conversely, nonmedicated patients were better at slowing down to maximize reward in the {IEV} condition. These effects of {DA} manipulation on cumulative Go/{NoGo} response time adaptation were captured with our a priori computational model of the basal ganglia, previously applied only to forced-choice tasks. There were also robust trial-to-trial changes in response time, but these single trial adaptations were not affected by disease or medication and are posited to rely on extrastriatal, possibly prefrontal, structures.},

            The explore-exploit dilemma describes the trade off that occurs any time we must choose between exploring unknown options and exploiting options we know well. Implicit in this trade off is how we value future rewards — exploiting is usually better in the short term, but in the longer term the benefits of exploration can be huge. Thus, in theory there should be a tight connection between how much people value future rewards, i.e. how much they discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards, and how likely they are to explore, with less ‘temporal discounting’ associated with more exploration. By measuring individual differences in temporal discounting and correlating them with explore-exploit behavior, we tested whether this theoretical prediction holds in practice. We used the 27-item Delay-Discounting Questionnaire to estimate temporal discounting and the Horizon Task to quantify two strategies of explore-exploit behavior: directed exploration, where information drives exploration by choice, and random exploration, where behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. We find a clear correlation between temporal discounting and directed exploration, with more temporal discounting leading to less directed exploration. Conversely, we find no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration. Unexpectedly, we find that the relationship with directed exploration appears to be driven by a correlation between temporal discounting and uncertainty seeking at short time horizons, rather than information seeking at long horizons. Taken together our results suggest a nuanced relationship between temporal discounting and explore-exploit behavior that may be mediated by multiple factors.},

Participants were 149 12–28-year-olds who completed a computational explore– exploit paradigm that manipulated reward value, information value, and decision horizon (i.e., the utility that information holds for future choices). Strategic directed exploration, defined as information seeking selective for long time horizons, emerged during adolescence and maintained its level through early adulthood. This age difference was partially driven by adolescents valuing immediate reward over new information. Strategic random exploration, defined as stochastic choice behavior selective for long time horizons, was invoked at comparable levels over the age range, and predicted individual differences in attitudes toward risk taking in daily life within the adolescent portion of the sample. Collectively, these findings reveal an expansion of the diversity of strategic exploration over development, implicate distinct mechanisms for directed and random exploratory strategies, and suggest novel mechanisms for adolescent-typical shifts in decision making.},

              Most real-world decisions involve a delicate balance between exploring unfamiliar alternatives and committing to the best known option.

Using {fMRI} (
              n
               = 31), we find that relative uncertainty is represented in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drives directed exploration, while total uncertainty is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drives random exploration. The decision value signal combining relative and total uncertainty to compute choice is reflected in motor cortex activity. The variance of this signal scales with total uncertainty, consistent with a sampling mechanism for random exploration. Overall, these results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.},

	abstract = {The adaptive regulation of the trade-off between pursuing a known reward (exploitation) and sampling lesser-known options in search of something better (exploration) is critical for optimal performance. Theory and recent empirical work suggest that humans use at least two strategies for solving this dilemma: a directed strategy in which choices are explicitly biased toward information seeking, and a random strategy in which decision noise leads to exploration by chance. Here we examined the hypothesis that random exploration is governed by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We administered atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker that increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine throughout the cortex, to 22 healthy human participants in a double-blind crossover design. We examined the effect of treatment on performance in a gambling task designed to produce distinct measures of directed exploration and random exploration. In line with our hypothesis we found an effect of atomoxetine on random, but not directed exploration. However, contrary to expectation, atomoxetine reduced rather than increased random exploration. We offer three potential explanations of our findings, involving the non-linear relationship between tonic {NE} and cognitive performance, the interaction of atomoxetine with other neuromodulators, and the possibility that atomoxetine affected phasic norepinephrine activity more so than tonic norepinephrine activity.},

            Making good decisions requires people to appropriately explore their available options and generalize what they have learned. While computational models can explain exploratory behavior in constrained laboratory tasks, it is unclear to what extent these models generalize to real-world choice problems. We investigate the factors guiding exploratory behavior in a dataset consisting of 195,333 customers placing 1,613,967 orders from a large online food delivery service. We find important hallmarks of adaptive exploration and generalization, which we analyze using computational models. In particular, customers seem to engage in uncertainty-directed exploration and use feature-based generalization to guide their exploration. Our results provide evidence that people use sophisticated strategies to explore complex, real-world environments.},

Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model.

            Beliefs about the controllability of positive or negative events in the environment can shape learning throughout the lifespan. Previous research has shown that adults’ learning is modulated by beliefs about the causal structure of the environment such that they update their value estimates to a lesser extent when the outcomes can be attributed to hidden causes. This study examined whether external causes similarly influenced outcome attributions and learning across development. Ninety participants, ages 7 to 25 years, completed a reinforcement learning task in which they chose between two options with fixed reward probabilities. Choices were made in three distinct environments in which different hidden agents occasionally intervened to generate positive, negative, or random outcomes. Participants’ beliefs about hidden-agent intervention aligned with the true probabilities of the positive, negative, or random outcome manipulation in each of the three environments. Computational modeling of the learning data revealed that while the choices made by both adults (ages 18–25) and adolescents (ages 13–17) were best fit by Bayesian reinforcement learning models that incorporate beliefs about hidden-agent intervention, those of children (ages 7–12) were best fit by a one learning rate model that updates value estimates based on choice outcomes alone. Together, these results suggest that while children demonstrate explicit awareness of the causal structure of the task environment, they do not implicitly use beliefs about the causal structure of the environment to guide reinforcement learning in the same manner as adolescents and adults.},

            A Pavlovian bias to approach reward-predictive cues and avoid punishment-predictive cues can conflict with instrumentally-optimal actions. Here, we propose that the brain arbitrates between Pavlovian and instrumental control by inferring which is a better predictor of reward. The instrumental predictor is more flexible; it can learn values that depend on both stimuli and actions, whereas the Pavlovian predictor learns values that depend only on stimuli. The arbitration theory predicts that the Pavlovian predictor will be favored when rewards are relatively uncontrollable, because the additional flexibility of the instrumental predictor is not useful. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the Pavlovian approach bias is stronger under low control compared to high control contexts.},

However, the neural and computational mechanisms of how the subjective value of self-efficacy beliefs, and the corresponding affect, influence the learning process remain unclear. We investigated these mechanisms during self-efficacy belief formation using {fMRI}, pupillometry, and computational modeling, and by analyzing individual differences in affective experience. Biases in the formation of self-efficacy beliefs were associated with affect, pupil dilation, and neural activity within the anterior insula, amygdala, ventral tegmental area/ substantia nigra, and {mPFC}. Specifically, neural and pupil responses mapped the valence of the prediction errors in correspondence with individuals’ experienced affective states and learning biases during self-efficacy belief formation. Together with the functional connectivity dynamics of the anterior insula within this network, our results provide evidence for neural and computational mechanisms of how we arrive at affected beliefs.},

In this article two fictional characters, Dr. Strong and Mr. Micawber, debate the use of such computational models ({CMs}) in psychiatry. We present four fundamental challenges to the use of {CMs} in psychiatry: (a) the applicability of mathematical approaches to core concepts in psychiatry such as subjective experiences, conflict and suffering; (b) whether psychiatry is mature enough to allow informative modelling; (c) whether theoretical techniques are powerful enough to approach psychiatric problems; and (d) the issue of communicating clinical concepts to theoreticians and vice versa. We argue that {CMs} have yet to influence psychiatric practice, but that they help psychiatric research in two fundamental ways: (a) to build better theories integrating psychiatry with neuroscience; and (b) to enforce explicit, global and efficient testing of hypotheses through more powerful analytical methods. {CMs} allow the complexity of a hypothesis to be rigorously weighed against the complexity of the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the path ahead. It points to stumbling blocks, like the poor communication between theoretical and medical communities. But it also identifies areas in which the contributions of {CMs} will likely be pivotal, like an understanding of social influences in psychiatry, and of the co-morbidity structure of psychiatric diseases.},

Abnormal causal attributions have long been studied in connection with psychiatric disorders, notably depression and paranoia; however, the mechanisms behind attributional inferences and the way they can go awry are not fully understood. We administered a novel, challenging, game of skill to a substantial population of healthy online participants, and collected trial-by-trial time series of both their beliefs about skill and attributions about the causes of the success and failure of real experienced outcomes. We found reciprocal relationships that provide empirical confirmation of the attribution-self representation cycle theory.

	abstract = {People are multi-faceted, typically good at some things but bad at others, and a critical aspect of social judgement is the ability to focus on those traits relevant for the task at hand. However, it remains unknown how the brain supports such context-dependent social judgement. Here, we examine how people represent multidimensional individuals, and how the brain extracts relevant information and ﬁlters out irrelevant information when comparing individuals within a speciﬁc dimension. Using human {fMRI}, we identify distinct neural representations in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}) and anterior insula ({AI}) supporting separation and selection of information for context-dependent social judgement. Causal evaluation using non-invasive brain stimulation shows that {AI} disruption alters the impact of relevant information on social comparison, whereas {dmPFC} disruption only affects the impact of irrelevant information. This neural circuit is distinct from the one supporting integration across, as opposed to separation of, different features of a multidimensional cognitive space.},

The ventral striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({ACCd}) are implicated in the making of cost–benefit decisions in the rat, but there is little information about how effort costs are processed and influence calculations of expected net value in other mammals including humans. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to determine whether and where activity in the human brain was available to guide effort-based cost–benefit valuation. Subjects were scanned while they performed a series of effortful actions to obtain secondary reinforcers. At the beginning of each trial, subjects were presented with one of eight different visual cues that they had learned indicated how much effort the course of action would entail and how much reward could be expected at its completion. Cue-locked activity in the ventral striatum and midbrain reflected the net value of the course of action, signaling the expected amount of reward discounted by the amount of effort to be invested. Activity in {ACCd} also reflected the interaction of both expected reward and effort costs. Posterior orbitofrontal and insular activity, however, only reflected the expected reward magnitude. The ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex may be the substrate of effort-based cost–benefit valuation in primates as well as in rats.},

Recently, neuroscientists have been turning to ecological approaches to address this issue, examining how animals evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of different options. We present here evidence from rodents and monkeys that demonstrate the degree to which they take into account work and energetic requirements when deciding what responses to make. These calculations appear to be critically mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) and mesolimbic dopamine ({DA}) pathways, with damage to either causing a bias towards options that are easily obtained but yield relatively smaller reward rather than alternatives that require more work but result in greater reward. The evaluation of such decisions appears to be carried out in systems independent of those involved in delay-discounting. We suggest that top-down signals from {ACC} to nucleus accumbens ({NAc}) and/or midbrain {DA} cells may be vital for overcoming effort-related response costs.},

We show that human subjects rapidly adapt their use of probability as a function of current resources, goals, and opportunities for further foraging. We demonstrate that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) carries signals indexing the pressure to pursue unlikely choices and signals related to the taking of such choices. We show that {dACC} exerts this control over behavior when it, rather than ventromedial prefrontal cortex, interacts with posterior cingulate cortex.},

            Decisions are based on value expectations derived from experience. We show that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and three other brain regions hold multiple representations of choice value based on different timescales of experience organized in terms of systematic gradients across the cortex. Some parts of each area represent value estimates based on recent reward experience while others represent value estimates based on experience over the longer term. The value estimates within these areas interact with one another according to their temporal scaling. Some aspects of the representations change dynamically as the environment changes. The spectrum of value estimates may act as a flexible selection mechanism for combining experience-derived value information with other aspects of value to allow flexible and adaptive decisions in changing environments.},

The model focuses on the current environment’s potential for reward, the timing of the individual’s own recent actions, and the outcomes of those actions. We show, by using ultrahigh-field {MRI} scanning, that in addition to anterior cingulate cortex within medial frontal cortex, a group of subcortical structures including striatum, substantia nigra, basal forebrain ({BF}), pedunculopontine nucleus ({PPN}), and habenula ({HB}) encode trial-by-trial variation in action time. Further analysis of the activity patterns found in each area together with psychophysiological interaction analysis and structural equation modeling suggested a model in which {BF} integrates contextual information that will influence the decision about when to act and communicates this information, in parallel with {PPN} and {HB} influences, to nigrostriatal circuits. It is then in the nigrostriatal circuit that action initiation per se begins.},

An especially acute version of this problem occurs when multiple people collaborate towards a joint outcome. Here we demonstrate that in such ambiguous social contexts, people engage in specific patterns of behaviour that we refer to as active disambiguation. This process helps individuals establish what they themselves, as opposed to others, control and what consequence they themselves cause or that another person causes. People identify when active disambiguation is needed and engage in it at that time. A pattern of activity in the supramarginal gyrus that emerges during and after active disambiguation is linked to establishing controllability and tracking the outcomes from which control is inferred. Activity in this brain region also signals a second learning mechanism, by which individuals attribute outcomes to themselves versus others, in proportion to their perceived control.},

Using computational modeling, univariate and multivariate analysis of human {fMRI}, and continuous theta-burst stimulation, we identiﬁed two brain regions that solved the task. Notably, as each outcome occurred, it was possible to decode the inference of its cause (the responsible character) from hippocampal activity. Activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}) updated estimates of association between cause—responsible character—and the outcome. Disruption of {dmPFC} activity impaired participants’ ability to update their estimate as a function of inferred responsibility but spared their ability to infer responsibility.},

This study takes an interdisciplinary perspective, merging computational decision making and developmental approaches to characterize age-related shifts in exploratory strategy from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants were 149 12–28-year-olds who completed a computational explore– exploit paradigm that manipulated reward value, information value, and decision horizon (i.e., the utility that information holds for future choices). Strategic directed exploration, defined as information seeking selective for long time horizons, emerged during adolescence and maintained its level through early adulthood. This age difference was partially driven by adolescents valuing immediate reward over new information. Strategic random exploration, defined as stochastic choice behavior selective for long time horizons, was invoked at comparable levels over the age range, and predicted individual differences in attitudes toward risk taking in daily life within the adolescent portion of the sample. Collectively, these findings reveal an expansion of the diversity of strategic exploration over development, implicate distinct mechanisms for directed and random exploratory strategies, and suggest novel mechanisms for adolescent-typical shifts in decision making.},

	abstract = {The adaptive regulation of the trade-off between pursuing a known reward (exploitation) and sampling lesser-known options in search of something better (exploration) is critical for optimal performance. Theory and recent empirical work suggest that humans use at least two strategies for solving this dilemma: a directed strategy in which choices are explicitly biased toward information seeking, and a random strategy in which decision noise leads to exploration by chance. Here we examined the hypothesis that random exploration is governed by the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. We administered atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker that increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine throughout the cortex, to 22 healthy human participants in a double-blind crossover design. We examined the effect of treatment on performance in a gambling task designed to produce distinct measures of directed exploration and random exploration. In line with our hypothesis we found an effect of atomoxetine on random, but not directed exploration. However, contrary to expectation, atomoxetine reduced rather than increased random exploration. We offer three potential explanations of our findings, involving the non-linear relationship between tonic {NE} and cognitive performance, the interaction of atomoxetine with other neuromodulators, and the possibility that atomoxetine affected phasic norepinephrine activity more so than tonic norepinephrine activity.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives—which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry—require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

	abstract = {The tension between exploration and exploitation is a primary challenge in decision making under uncertainty. Optimal models of choice prescribe that individuals resolve this tension by evaluating how information gained from their choices will improve future choices. However, research in behavioral economics and psychology has yielded conﬂicting evidence about whether people consider the future during exploratory choice, particularly in complex, uncertain environments. Adding to the empirical evidence on this issue, we examine exploratory decision making in a novel approachavoid paradigm. In the ﬁrst set of experiments we ﬁnd that people parametrically increase their exploration when the expected number of future encounters with a prospect is larger. In the second we demonstrate that when the number of future encounters is unknown, as is often the case in everyday life, people are sensitive to the relative frequency of future encounters with a prospect. Our experiments show that people adaptively utilize information about the future when deciding to explore, a tendency that may shape decisions across several real-world domains.},

	abstract = {Many decisions involve a choice between exploring unknown opportunities and exploiting well-known options. Work across a variety of domains, from animal foraging to human decision making, has suggested that animals solve such ``explore-exploit dilemmas'' with a mixture of two strategies: one driven by information seeking (directed exploration) and the other by behavioral variability (random exploration). Here we propose a unifying account in which these two strategies emerge from a kind of stochastic planning, known in the machine learning literature as Deep Exploration.  In this model, the explore-exploit decision is made by stochastic simulation of plausible futures that are deep, in that they extend far into the future, and narrow, in that the number of possible futures they consider is small. By applying Deep Exploration to a simple explore-exploit task we show theoretically how directed and random exploration can emerge in these settings. Moreover, we show that Deep Exploration implies a tradeoff between directed and random exploration that is mediated by the number of simulations, or samples --- with more samples leading to increased directed exploration and decreased random exploration at the expense of greater time taken to respond. By measuring human behavior on the same simple task, we show that this reaction-time-mediated tradeoff exists in human behavior both between and within participants. We therefore suggest that Deep Exploration is a unifying account of explore-exploit behavior in humans.},

Study 1 used Google mobility data and nation-level personality data from 31 countries, both before and after region-specific legislative interventions, finding that agreeable nations are most consistently compliant with mobility restrictions. Study 2 (N ¼ 105,857) replicated these findings using individual-level data, showing that several personality traits predict sheltering in place behavior, but extraverts are especially likely to remain mobile. Overall, our analyses reveal robust relationships between traits and regulatory compliance (mobility behavior), both before and after region-specific legislative interventions, and the global declaration of the pandemic. Further, we find significant effects on reasons for leaving home, as well as age and gender differences, particularly relating to female agreeableness for previous and future social mobility behaviors. These sex differences, however, are only visible for those living in households with two or more people, suggesting that such findings may be driven by division of labor.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), we show that this behavior is speciﬁcally associated with striatal activity, in a manner consistent with computational accounts of decision making under uncertainty. Furthermore, this activity predicts interindividual differences in susceptibility to novelty. These data indicate that the brain uses perceptual novelty to approximate choice uncertainty in decision making, which in certain contexts gives rise to a newly identiﬁed and quantiﬁable source of human irrationality.},

Small samples, because of the high dispersion of their sampling distribution, facilitate above-threshold contingencies. Across a broad range of parameters, the resulting small-sample advantage in terms of hits is stronger than their disadvantage in false alarms. Computer simulations and experiments support the model predictions. The relative advantage of small samples is most apparent when information loss is low, when the threshold is high relative to the ecological contingency, and when the sampling process is self-truncated.},

	abstract = {When people have access to information sources such as newspaper weather forecasts, drug-package inserts, and mutual-fund brochures, all of which provide convenient descriptions of risky prospects, they can make decisions from description. When people must decide whether to back up their computer’s hard drive, cross a busy street, or go out on a date, however, they typically do not have any summary description of the possible outcomes or their likelihoods. For such decisions, people can call only on their own encounters with such prospects, making decisions from experience. Decisions from experience and decisions from description can lead to dramatically different choice behavior. In the case of decisions from description, people make choices as if they overweight the probability of rare events, as described by prospect theory. We found that in the case of decisions from experience, in contrast, people make choices as if they underweight the probability of rare events, and we explored the impact of two possible causes of this underweighting—reliance on relatively small samples of information and overweighting of recently sampled information. We conclude with a call for two different theories of risky choice.},

The present paper examines the effect of foregone payoffs on underweighting rare but possible events in repeated choice tasks. Previous studies have not demonstrated any long-lasting effects of foregone payoffs (following repeated presentation of a task) when foregone payoffs do not add much information. The present paper highlights the conditions and the contributing factors for the occurrence of such long-lasting effects. An experimental study compares the effect of foregone payoffs under different degrees of rarity of the negative payoff. It is demonstrated that foregone payoffs increase the selection from risky alternatives with extremely rare and highly negative outcomes, and that this effect does not diminish with repeated presentation of the task. These ﬁndings can be summarized using a surprisingly simple reinforcement-learning model. The ﬁndings are discussed in the context of the potential long-term effect of social learning.

Experience was found to lead to a reversed common ratio/certainty effect, more risk seeking in the gain than in the loss domain, and to an underweighting of small probabilities. Only one of the examined properties of description-based decisions, loss aversion, seems to emerge robustly in these ‘feedback-based’ decisions.

Studies of decisions from experience have observed that people tend to rely on relatively small samples from payoff distributions, and small samples are at times rendered even smaller because of recency. We suggest one contributing and previously unnoticed reason for reliance on frugal search: Small samples amplify the difference between the expected earnings associated with the payoff distributions, thus making the options more distinct and choice easier.

	abstract = {A striking ﬁnding has emerged recently in the literature: When decision makers are faced with essentially the same choice, their preferences differ as a function of whether options are described or are ‘‘experienced’’ via observation and feedback. For example, when presented the described choice: (A) A 90\% chance of \$0 and a 10\% chance of \$10 or (B) \$1 for sure, people tend to prefer (A). But when those same two options are experienced through observation of ‘‘draws’’ from two payoff distributions that match the described options, the modal preference reverses. Why? This is just one question that the papers in this special issue address. In addition, they address the rich repertoire of issues that arise when one considers experience-based choices. The decisions-fromexperience paradigm—with its focus on the acquisition and integration of information prior to choice, as well the choice itself—taps many of the fundamentals of psychology (learning, memory, encoding, knowledge representation, modelling) thus inspiring novel and fruitful avenues for research. This paper reviews recent research on experience-based choice, and highlights the contribution of the papers in the special issue. The paper introduces a framework that places different types of decisions along a continuum of uncertainty about what one is choosing between, which emphasizes the rich and varied role of ‘‘experience’’ in decision making. It ends by identifying important unsolved questions that are ripe for future research. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here, we instead consider how stereotypes arise from basic processes of approach and avoidance in social learning. Across ﬁve studies, we show that initial negative interactions with some members of a group can cause subsequent avoidance of the entire group, and that this avoidance perpetuates stereotypes in two ways. First, when information gain is contingent on approaching the target, avoidance restricts the information available with which to update one’s beliefs. Second, computational models that consider the perceiver’s full reinforcement history demonstrate that avoidance directly reinforces itself, such that initial avoidance of group members increases the probability of later acts of avoidance toward that group. Finally, we ﬁnd initial evidence for a potential dissociation between behavior and explicit beliefs, with avoidance reinforcing avoidant behaviors without necessarily affecting self-reported beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that avoidance behaviors toward members of social groups can perpetuate inaccurate negative beliefs and expectations about those groups, such that initial interactions with a group have a compounding effect on overall impressions.},

Here we examine the nature of goal tradeoffs in intergroup decision-making using a novel task in which participants simultaneously make monetary decisions for themselves, an arbitrary ingroup, and the corresponding outgroup. Across four behavioural studies and one eye-tracking study (total N = 704), we find that goals in intergroup contexts are pursued sequentially rather than concurrently, with non-linear upweighting of group-related goals when self-related goals cannot be pursued. Further, we find evidence for stronger self-ingroup than self-outgroup tradeoffs, which manifest in both altered attention to information and altered use of the attended information in decision-making. The results shed light on the cognitive structuring of interrelated goals in intergroup decisionmaking, furthering our understanding of when and how both intergroup biases and prosocial behaviour may emerge.},

Our experimental work is motivated by rational analysis of the problem that makes strong predictions about information search and reward seeking in static and changeable environments.

Experiments 3 and 4 further demonstrated that group-based reward effects on interaction choices persisted even when past group reward value was no longer predicted of future positive outcomes, consistent with a habit-like expression of group bias.

	abstract = {While there is no doubt that social signals affect human reinforcement learning, there is still no consensus about how this process is computationally implemented. To address this issue, we compared three psychologically plausible hypotheses about the algorithmic implementation of imitation in reinforcement learning. The first hypothesis, decision biasing ({DB}), postulates that imitation consists in transiently biasing the learner’s action selection without affecting their value function. According to the second hypothesis, model-based imitation ({MB}), the learner infers the demonstrator’s value function through inverse reinforcement learning and uses it to bias action selection. Finally, according to the third hypothesis, value shaping ({VS}), the demonstrator’s actions directly affect the learner’s value function. We tested these three hypotheses in 2 experiments (N = 24 and N = 44) featuring a new variant of a social reinforcement learning task. We show through model comparison and model simulation that {VS} provides the best explanation of learner’s behavior. Results replicated in a third independent experiment featuring a larger cohort and a different design (N = 302). In our experiments, we also manipulated the quality of the demonstrators’ choices and found that learners were able to adapt their imitation rate, so that only skilled demonstrators were imitated. We proposed and tested an efficient meta-learning process to account for this effect, where imitation is regulated by the agreement between the learner and the demonstrator. In sum, our findings provide new insights and perspectives on the computational mechanisms underlying adaptive imitation in human reinforcement learning.},

Standard multiarmed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option’s spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.},

Insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showed significantly greater activity on observe trials compared to bet trials, suggesting that these regions play a role in driving exploration. A model-based analysis of task performance suggested that subjects chose to observe until a critical evidence threshold was reached.

We study how children between the ages of 4 and 9 search in an explore–exploit task with spatially correlated rewards, where exhaustive exploration is infeasible and not all options can be experienced. By combining behavioral data with a computational model that decomposes search into similarity-based generalization, uncertainty-directed exploration, and random exploration, we map out developmental trajectories of generalization and exploration. The behavioral data show strong developmental differences in children's capability to exploit environmental structure, with performance and adaptiveness of sampling decisions increasing with age. Through model-based analyses, we disentangle different forms of exploration, finding signature of both uncertainty-directed and random exploration. The amount of random exploration strongly decreases as children get older, supporting the notion of a developmental “cooling off” process that modulates the randomness in sampling. However, even at the youngest age range, children do not solely rely on random exploration. Even as random exploration begins to taper off, children are actively seeking out options with high uncertainty in a goal-directed fashion, and using inductive inferences to generalize their experience to novel options. Our findings provide critical insights into the behavioral and computational principles underlying the developmental trajectory of learning and exploration.},

	abstract = {In repeated decision problems for which it is possible to learn from experience, people should actively seek out uncertain options, rather than avoid ambiguity or uncertainty, in order to learn and improve future decisions. Research on human behavior in a variety of multiarmed-bandit tasks supports this prediction. Multiarmed-bandit tasks involve repeated decisions between options with initially unknown reward distributions and require a careful balance between learning about relatively unknown options (exploration) and obtaining high immediate rewards (exploitation). Resolving this exploration-exploitation dilemma optimally requires considering not only the estimated value of each option, but also the uncertainty in these estimations. Bayesian learning naturally quantifies uncertainty and hence provides a principled framework to study how humans resolve this dilemma. On the basis of computational modeling and behavioral results in bandit tasks, I argue that human learning, attention, and exploration are guided by uncertainty. These results support Bayesian theories of cognition and underpin the fundamental role of subjective uncertainty in both learning and decision making.},

	abstract = {Examining children's decisions to explore or exploit the environment provides a window into their developing metacognition and reflection capacities. Reinforcement learning, characterized by the balance between exploring new options (exploration) and utilizing known ones (exploitation), is central to this discussion. Children initially exhibit broad and intensive exploration, which gradually shifts toward exploitation as they grow. We review major theories and empirical findings, highlighting two main exploration strategies: random and directed. The former involves stochastic choices without considering information or rewards, while the latter is driven by reducing uncertainty for information gain. Behavioral tasks such as n-armed bandit, horizon, and patch foraging tasks are used to study these strategies. Findings on the n-armed bandit and horizon tasks showed mixed results on whether random exploration decreases over time. Directed exploration consistently decreases with age, but its emergence depends on task difficulty. In patch-foraging tasks, adults tend to overexploit (staying too long in one patch) and children overexplore (leaving too early), whereas adolescents display the most optimal balance. The paper also addresses open questions regarding the mechanisms supporting early exploration and the application of these strategies in real-life contexts like persistence. Future research should further investigate the relation between cognitive control, such as executive function and metacognition, and explore-exploit strategies, and examine their practical implications for adaptive learning and decision-making in children.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives—which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry—require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

	abstract = {Exposure to uncontrollable outcomes has been found to trigger learned helplessness, a state in which the agent, because of lack of exploration, fails to take advantage of regained control. Although the implications of this phenomenon have been widely studied, its underlying cause remains undetermined. One can learn not to explore because the environment is uncontrollable, because the average reinforcement for exploring is low, or because rewards for exploring are rare. In the current research, we tested a simple experimental paradigm that contrasts the predictions of these three contributors and offers a unified psychological mechanism that underlies the observed phenomena. Our results demonstrate that learned helplessness is not correlated with either the perceived controllability of one’s environment or the average reward, which suggests that reward prevalence is a better predictor of exploratory behavior than the other two factors. A simple computational model in which exploration decisions were based on small samples of past experiences captured the empirical phenomena while also providing a cognitive basis for feelings of uncontrollability.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of limited information in a sequential search setting where a single selection is to be made from a set of random potential options. We consider both a full-information problem, where the decision maker observes the exact value of each option as she searches, and a partial-information problem, in which the decision maker only learns the rank of the current option relative to the options that have already been observed. We develop a model that allows for a sharp contrast between search behavior in the two information settings, both theoretically and empirically. We present the results of an experiment that tests, and supports, the key prediction of our model analysis—limited information induces longer search. Our data further suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmarks in both informational settings. Importantly, subjects in our partial-information conditions are prone to stop prematurely during early stages of the search process and to suboptimally continue the search during late stages. We propose a simple model that succinctly captures the interplay of two symmetric choice and judgment biases that have asymmetric (but opposing) effects on the length of search.
